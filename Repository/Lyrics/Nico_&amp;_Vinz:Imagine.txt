Imagine 
Nico &amp; Vinz

[Intro:]
Hmmm-mah-mah-imagine
Hmmm-mah-mah-imagine (hooooah)
Hmmm-mah-mah-imagine
Hmmm-mah-mah-imagine (hooooah)

[Verse:]
I see yo tears in the night, lay it all on me
Ya built a wall inside, just let it fall from me
I feel yo pain and lonely, don't be afraid to show me
Let it rain upon me, I'll be here fo' ya

[Verse 2:]
I met an ol' man once and he said to me
The only thing that matters is what ya believe
If you don't stand for somethin' you'll fall fo' anythin'
In case you're wonderin' I'll be here fo' ya

[Chorus:]
Hmmm-mah-mah-imagine, aye-ya-ye-imagine
Ooh oh, imagine
Could ya eva imagine?
What you've done, now you're here
And ya fought through all of yo fins
Say yeah imagine
Could ya eva imagine?

[Verse 3:]
Every melody can turn into a symphony instantly
I know that ya were meant for me
Even tho it was so hard to see
I knew that we could be, ya did the same fo' me
Now I'll be here for ya

[Chorus:]
Hmmm-mah-mah-imagine, aye-ya-ye-imagine
Ooh oh, imagine
Could ya eva imagine?
What you've done, now you're here
And ya fought through all of yo fins
Say yeah imagine
Could ya eva imagine?

[Verse 4:]
I'm just a humble, lil sail with 2 much to prove
But my boat's so small and the ocean soo huge
And I don't wanna go half on a dream
So I need ya to be a part of my team
I could neva pretend or act like it's just me
Without ya where would I be? Imagine

[Chorus:]
Hmmm-mah-mah-imagine, aye-ya-ye-imagine
Ooh oh, imagine
Could ya eva imagine?
What you've done, now you're here
And ya fought through all of yo fins
Say yeah imagine
Could ya eva imagine?
