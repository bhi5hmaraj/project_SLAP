World Peace 
Rihanna

[Verse 1]
Hey yo this kid in Australia
Said he idolized me
If you don't know why
Then it's time to watch me
A young papi with the confidence
Of Rocky in a boxing match
Early mornings practicing my rhymes
13 rocking a stocking cap
Skinny nigga told my reflection I'll never settle
Said if I gain some weight
Then I would one day try to wrestle
Wanted to play ball and be a UNLV rebel
When I let my talent go to waste
Cause I couldn't keep up my grades
What a shame
Now I'm living out my second dream
Grown into some shit you've never seen
Now I'm onto better things
It just goes to show
When you travel a lot and you be on the road
We all thriving to be comfortable and happy
But in life we go the distance
A major part in life is
Building the life you wanna live with
I know we lack patience
But you gotta stay consistent
Only you can slow you down
Turn your dreams into commitments
Making sense with a sentence
Golden Age and I'm vintage
1990 to now what we doing they did it
You could be fooled in a minute
I'm just tryna talk that shit until I'm finished
The lost soul that's protected by my religion
I represent World Peace

[Chorus]
Lately I've been feeling a certain way
Peace signs in every picture that I take
I represent World Peace yo, yo
Smoking weed until the feeling goes away
Spreading love until I'm in and out my day
I represent World Peace

[Verse 2]
I'm extremely excited without it hiding
Niggers see me smiling
But y'all niggers don't know the half of it
I'm talking bout a kid that grew up without having shit
And sorted out a plan
And then turned into a man
Y'all understand the fans
And how fans follow the artist
But what if some man
Give âem something other than trends?
What you recommend
What you stepping in?
Who you follow?
What you represent?
Nigger what set you in?
Man we all started from the bottom
Started with a problem
Before I was ever crawling
I was born into my miseries
Came out with my hidden talents
Now the rest is history
Riding but if you ain't providing
That don't mean shit to me
You could be the hardest nigga walking
But the hardest niggers working is the bosses
Keep it authentic
Cause the image got you confused
Anybody would tell you it's a lose, lose
Nigga do you?

[Chorus]
Lately I've been feeling a certain way
Peace signs in every picture that I take
I represent World Peace yo, yo
Smoking weed until the feeling goes away
Spreading love until I'm in and out my day
I represent World Peace

[Verse 3]
I just wanna give you
Something you can keep in mind
Be strong don't let nothing
Disturb yo peace of mind
Read between the lines
Teaching men to rhyme
You can't change overnight
We all need some time
Homey don't act like I ain't out here
On my ones and twos
Yo fundamentals was rented
And it's a bunch of you
Me I been the same
Since my momma was buying lunch-ables
Grew through some functions
Respected cause I'm lovable
Think good thoughts
Speak good words
Take good actions
Yeah that's what the world deserves
A man in power
That's gonna empower the people first
In Howard College they listen
Came all the way from the dirt
Agree to disagree just because
I'd rather have them legalize
A plant then feed the people nicotine
Sell the devil's juice and
They gonna support it by any means
On they TV screens nigga please
I represent World Peace

[Chorus]
Lately I've been feeling a certain way
Peace signs in every picture that I take
I represent World Peace yo, yo
Smoking weed until the feeling goes away
Spreading love until I'm in and out my day
I represent World Peace
