Who's Gonna Stand Up 
Neil Young

Protect the wild, tomorrow's child
Protect the land from the greed of man
Take down the dams, stand up to oil
Protect the plants, and renew the soil

Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me

Damn the dams, save the rivers
Starve the takers and feed the givers
Build a dream, save the world
We're the people know as earth

Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me

Ban fossil fuel, draw the line
Before we build, one more pipeline
Ban fracking now, save the waters
And build a life, for our sons and daughters

Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
Who's gonna say that she's had enough?
Who's gonna take on the big machine?
Who's gonna stand up and save the earth?
This all starts with you and me

Who's gonna stand up
Who's gonna stand up
Who's gonna stand up
Who's gonna stand up
Who's gonna stand up
