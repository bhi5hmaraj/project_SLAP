Break The Rules 
Charli XCX

[Verse:]
Electric lights, blow my mind, I feel alright
Neva stop, it's how we ride, comin' up until we die
You catch my eye, bitch, you wanna fight? I'm so alive
Neva stop, it's how we ride, comin' up until we die

[Chorus: X2]
I don't wanna go to school
I just want to break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancin shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting higher, getting wrecked
I don't want to go to school
I just wanna break the rules

[Verse 2:]
I'm such a star, Queen Boulevard
Blaze thru the dark
Neva stop, it's how we ride
Comin' up until we die

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna go to school
I just want to break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancin shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting higher, getting wrecked
I don't want to go to school
I just wanna break the rules

[Bridge:]
Get my guitar! Sunglasses on! So light it up!
Neva stop, it's how we ride, comin' up until we die

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna go to school
I just want to break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancin shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting higher, getting wrecked
I don't want to go to school
I just wanna break the rules
