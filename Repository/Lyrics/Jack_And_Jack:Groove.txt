Girl, the way you dance has got me going insane
Now it's time to turn on the lights
Yeah, so I can get a better look at you
You're the baddest in the place, damn who had knew
A young Bobby Darin, the way that I put in work on the mic
Staying up all night I certainly might

Oh, I want you all the time, yeah
Breathe in my life, feel it in my spine
So get down on the floor
Let it take control
It's got me wanting more

So please don't stop
Please, please don't stop, please

C'mon baby let me in
Till I will let you loose
So much that we could do (groove)
Feel that I'm feeling inside here (I got the)
Feel that I'm feeling inside here (I got the groove)

Tell me I no explaining it
From the Mediterranean all the way to the cities without names and shit
Not gonna allow, I'm just a crazy kid who's chasing his
We started from the basement bitch
I gotta work harder than the bigga man
Do you understand the reason that I got dinner plans
'Cause I'm doing it big, but now it's time to have a litte fun
Girl, the way you work, you should be employee of mine

Oh, I want you all the time, yeah
Breathe in my life, yeah
Feel it in my spine
So get down on the floor

Feel that I'm feeling inside here (I got the groove)
