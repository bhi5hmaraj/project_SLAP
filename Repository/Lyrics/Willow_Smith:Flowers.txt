Flowers 
Willow Smith

You wished upon a star
Saw your mother snap back and now you're where you started
My heart aches wanna see your face
That's the story of this life but my soul saw it twice
Never had a problem but my soul seams to fight throw the other fist of life

But it's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
We were walking on clouds with the grays come down
And they wiped this all out

But it's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
We were walking on clouds with the grays come down
And they wiped this all out
But it's the flower

I wanna be an atlant
Let's get the 10, let's get the 10 by 4
And we locked out the door, locked out the door
We'll see what they be hiding, let me tell you bout the story of posiden
He was a young boy, he wasn't enlightened kinda like Jaded
Kinda like the way we look in the sky
And we see the cam trails
And we nearly all cry and nearly just die
And nearly just try to help 'em
The government it tryna, tryna sell 'em, not help 'em
But the indigoes are here and we remember
Remembered how we all shift the weather
Because love is the air we breathe
The people we see, the realization that make us a unity
So you and me and I and I

We're the flower
We're the flower
We're the flower
We're the flower
We're the flower
We were walking on clouds with the grays come down
And they wiped this all out

But it's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
It's the flower
We were walking on clouds with the grays come down
And they wiped this all out
But it's the flower
