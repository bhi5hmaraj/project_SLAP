Black Lake 
Bjork

[Verse 1]
Our love was my womb but our bond has broken
And my shield is gone, my protection is taken
I am 1 wound in my pulsatin' body
Sufferin' being

[Verse 2]
My heart is enormous, lake black with potion
I am blind, drownin' in this ocean

[Verse 3]
My soul torn apart, and my spirit unspoken [?]
Into far over the mist, over...

[Verse 4]
True fear may limits last
And emotions, I am bored of your
Apocalyptic obsessions
Did I love you too much?
Devotion and me broken
So I repent, destroyed
(I must, I...)

[Verse 4]
I did it for love
I honored my feelings
You betrayed your own part
Corroded that [?]

[Verse 5]
Finally, what out of place
Our own secret, mutual mission which
And you abandoned

[Verse 6]
True happiness and true belief
Pure heart in this darkness
I grant inside notes
We hold inside up and down
Lake darkness eternity and [?]

[Verse 7]
I am all-glowing shining rocket
Returning home as I enter
Sea of misfit, I burn off
Layer by layer
