Die For You 
Falling In Reverse

[Verse 1]
I admit, that I'm far from perfect
Words are here to touch me like I want to
The skies will bleed, come follow me, your puppet
I will never trust you cuz our loyalty is dead!

[Chorus]
I would have died for you
I've put myself hanging on your words
And it goes to show how bad it hurts
For what it's worth
Some things are better left unsaid

[Verse 2]
You won't destroy me! This is your warning!
I have a dark side! I have an omen
[?] are sacred, 1000 years of torment
Face up like a monster, forever like no other

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ah, pick it up! I'm no longer able too
Believe in what we're fighting for
Your lying soul will burn below
[?] burning efforts slow
Kill the person that you call your father
And your mother, banishing that race
That with the horror taught you of the dishonor
The world as we know it is a muthafuckin' battleground!

[Chorus]
