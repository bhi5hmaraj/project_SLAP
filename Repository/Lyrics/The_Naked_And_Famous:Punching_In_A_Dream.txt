Punching In A Dream 
The Naked And Famous

[Verse 1: Alissa]
All the lights go down as I crawl into the spaces
If I died on the screens
Life tearing at the seams

[Chorus]
Way-yay-yay-yay-yay
I don't ever want to be here
Like punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmare

[Bridge]
If it falls apart I would surely wake it
Bright lights turn me clean
This is worse than it seems

[Chorus]
Way-yay-yay-yay-yay
I don't ever want to be here
Like punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmare

[Verse 2: Tom]
They'll get through
They'll get you
In the place that you feel it the most
When you're cornered
When it's forming
In the place that you wish was a ghost

[Bridge: Alissa]
Wo-oah
Wo-oah
Wo-oah, wo-oah
Wo-oah
Wo-oah
Wo-oah, wo-oah

[Outro]
Way-yay-yay-yay-yay
I don't ever want to be here
Like punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmare
Way-yay-yay-yay-yay
I don't ever want to be here
Like punching in a dream breathing life into my nightmare
