Show You Off 
Jason Aldean

[Verse:]
We can go around, club hopping
Tell you all I want to do is drop in
Have a drink and catch a good band
Couple songs and hey we're gone again
Act like that's all we're doing, the truth is

[Chorus:]
I just want to show you off
Drive em all crazy, watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
It's a fine girl, damn, be all I ever saw
I just want to show you off

[Verse 2:]
Maybe take a ride down broadway
All the Dodges and the Fords and the Chevrolets
Slow rolling, looking over and
Girl you've got that super cab glowing
Roll down that tinted window

[Bridge]
There you go, I just want to show you off
Drive em all crazy, watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
It's a fine girl, damn
Be all I ever saw, I just want to show you off

Might look like we're just cruising, truth is, truth is

[Chorus:]
I just want to show you off
Drive em all crazy, watch all the boys hate me
Is that so wrong? Come on
I just want the world to see how lucky I am
It's a fine girl, damn, be all I ever saw
I just want to show you off
I just want to show you off
