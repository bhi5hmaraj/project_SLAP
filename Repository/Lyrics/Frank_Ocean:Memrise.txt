Memrise 
Frank Ocean

[Intro:]
Memorise (x9)

[Verse]
I memorized the wayward expressions
Never look down
Never let you see me down
I memorized the way no directions
Can I come over now
I'd like to stay a little while
I memorized your body exposed
I could fuck you all night long
From a memory alone

I never forget a face
Don't go plastic on me
Nothing's set in stone
You're not dipped in gold
Dipped in gold
You can't breathe if you're dipped in gold
You are not on paper
You are not a copy
You're so, you're so... So thick, so thick
