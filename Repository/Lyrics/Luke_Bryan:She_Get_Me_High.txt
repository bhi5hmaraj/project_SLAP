She Get Me High 
Luke Bryan

Find me a place in the sand
Clean these old shades off
Damn y'all don't understand
All she wants to do is dance

She get me high
She get me low
She got the key to this old bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving
It's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti
On an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Clouds roll by
She get me high

Don't nobody block my view
Hell you can find a spot and watch too
Watch as she makes this beach
Light up like the sky on New Year's Eve
Love it when she's locked on me

She get me high
She get me low
She got the key to this old bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving
It's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti
On an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high

Come on!

She said; "boy, it's time to take me home"
Don't even grab your stuff
Just lay me on down
By the full moonshine
You 'bout to be all mine

She get me high
She get me low
She got the keys to this old bronco
In her bare feet, in her high heels
No matter how she moving
It's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti
On an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high
Clouds roll by
She get me high

Hey
