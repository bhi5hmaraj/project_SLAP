Ignition &amp; Friction 
Transit

You set a fire and you walked away
Set me free of my hopes and dreams
It's so hard to pinpoint the blame

Then there's me, the general consensus judge and jury
Then there's me, everybody screaming guilty

And I'm wrong as you fan the flames into my face
I'm wrong as you watch the pieces fall away
You can try to catch my name, save it for a lonely grave
Ignition and friction burn away

You set a fire and you walked away
And I'm still learning how to read all the smoke signals you send me
Set a fire and you walked away
Get the picture I was framed
It's so hard to pinpoint the blame

Then there's me, the general consensus judge and jury
Then there's me, everybody screaming guilty

And I'm wrong as you fan the flames into my face
I'm wrong as you watch the pieces fall away
You can try to catch my name, save it for a lonely grave
Ignition and friction burn away

I won't take up too much space
Save it for a lonely grave
No one's visiting me anyway

And I'm wrong as you fan the flames into my face
I'm wrong as you watch the pieces fall away
You can try to catch my name, save it for a lonely grave
Ignition and friction burn away
