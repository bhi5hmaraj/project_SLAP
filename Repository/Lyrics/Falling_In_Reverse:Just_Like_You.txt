Just Like You 
Falling In Reverse

(Na na na na, na na na na, nanananananana)
I'm aware that I am an asshole
I really don't care about all of that though
I got nothing to prove
(Na na na na, na na na na)
But honestly I'm just like you

I've got a bad case of ADD (ah huh)
I've been this way since 17
I got a fucked up brain
And a really bad attitude
I blame it on my drug abuse

So you don't want to be
Too close to me
Cause you might see my broken heart

I'm aware that I am an asshole
I really don't care about all of that though
I'm living my life
The way that I want to
And you can't deny
That honestly I'm just like you
(Na na na na, na na na na, nanananananana)
Just like you
(Na na na na, na na na na, nanananananana)
Just like you

I've so lonely for the longest time (ah huh)
They tell me that I'm such a loveable guy (yeah right)
(2 lines more?)
Or could it be something I just said?

You don't want to be
Too close to me
Cause you might see my broken heart

I'm aware that I am an asshole
I really don't care about all of that though
I'm living my life
The way that I want to
And you can't deny
That honestly I'm just like you
(Na na na na, na na na na, nanananananana)
Just like you
(Na na na na, na na na na, nanananananana)

And I'm always stuck with some bad luck
And I'm just a boy who's angry at his mom
And I hope infact she breaks her back
That moment I step on this crack

And don't tell me I'm not worth it
Cause you are far from perfect

I'm aware that you are all assholes
Who the hell cares about all of that though?

I'm aware that I am an asshole
I really don't care about all of that though
I'm living my life
The way that I want to
And you can't deny
That honestly I'm just like you
(Na na na na, na na na na, nanananananana)
