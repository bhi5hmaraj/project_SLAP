Guardian 
Sky Ferreira

[Verse 1]
Always thought I needed a guardian
And now that I've got one, I wanna be free
I don't wanna live my life unhappily
I'm locked up in chains, laid down on the floor
[?]
I'm not for a cry, I'm not gonna be
No matter how hard it might be

[Chorus]
I wanna be free
From the dark that lives deep inside of me
Free from all the eyes I see watching over me
Don't want you to be there
Don't want you to care for me anymore
I wanna be free of the guardian
I am the guardian

[Verse 2]
That small time with you that I'm looking forward
Was nothing I like [?]
So feel like a child, somewhere within
Nothing underneath the skin
Too tired to live, too tired to die
So I just stay high
I just wanna be in spite of [?]
Should I just keep trying?

[Chorus] (2x)

[Outro]
I am the guardian
I am the guardian
I am the guardian
