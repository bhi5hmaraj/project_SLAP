Nothing Is Over 
Oh Land

In my head, in my heart
I've had packed and I moved on
Now you're here, now you're gone
Turn the lights off and on
And we're so scared to choose
Where we win, where we lose
'Cause love still is here!
In your eyes, in your face
It's like nothing has changed
And I want to believe that it isn't too late
And our skin when we touch
It can still feel the rush
'Cause love still is here!

Can't we go just a little bit longer,
I don't know if it's right or wrong
But just found out that nothing is over
Can't we try it just a little bit harder
We'll burn just a little bit brighter
Tell me now nothing is over,
Nothing is over!

Turn the clock, let's go back
Clear our words, go from scratch
And you walk up to me,
I'll be wearing that dress
When you'll asked me to stay
Swear I won't run away
'Cause love you can see!

Can't we go just a little bit longer,
I don't know if it's right or wrong
But just found out that nothing is over
Can't we try it just a little bit harder
We'll burn just a little bit brighter
Tell me now nothing is over,
Nothing is over!

Now can't you see it's hiding in there
Break underneath and us we make
All we've got to do is carry out our way.

Can't we go just a little bit longer,
I don't know if it's right or wrong
But just found out that nothing is over
Can't we try it just a little bit harder
We'll burn just a little bit brighter
Tell me now nothing is over,
Nothing is over!
