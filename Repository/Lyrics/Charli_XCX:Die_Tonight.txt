Die Tonight 
Charli XCX

[Chorus:]
Oh, I could die tonight
Cuz I got the magic in my veins
And I'm goin' hard with all my friends
I could die tonight

[Verse:]
Let's get started, pool side of the party
Rolling Stones on my phone
Hangin' in yo bedroom, feelin' like we're rock n' roll
End of the summer, I've been down with lovers
Playing under stars to shine
Hold up your bombs(?) now
Don't you know that it's not time?

[Chorus:]
Oh, I could die tonight
Cuz I got the magic in my blood
And I'm staying till the sun comes up
Oh, I could die tonight
Cuz I got the magic in my veins
And I'm goin' hard with all my friends
I could die tonight

[Verse 2:]
Back at the hotel, ringin' all the doorbells
Now we're feelin' so alive
Come to the top floor jumpin' like we're bout to fly
No-one's leavin', bout to blow the ceilin'
When we turn it after ten
Wake up in the mornin', gonna do it all again

[Chorus: X2]
Oh, I could die tonight
Cuz I got the magic in my blood
And I'm staying till the sun comes up
Oh, I could die tonight
Cuz I got the magic in my veins
And I'm goin' hard with all my friends
I could die tonight
