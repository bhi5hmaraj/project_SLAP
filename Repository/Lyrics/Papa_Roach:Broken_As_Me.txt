Broken As Me 
Papa Roach

You're Just as broken as me

Shut your mouth
Cuz I can see through the lies
We're only getting sicker
From the secrets we hide
Disaster is, a master as
We lie here burning in bed
But something tells me
I cannot give up on you yet
I will not give up, on you today

I will forgive, forget
Cause I know that it will set me free
But all that's left is the emptiness inside of me
(my heart)
You murder my heart
Broke my trust and watched me fade away
Now I see, now I see
That you're just as broken as me

You're just as broken as me

You always play the victim
And you just can't decide
If the vicious way we loved each other
Fucked up our lives
Well we're standing in the aftermath of emptiness is what's left
And if you really love me, will you love me to death

[?]

I will forgive, forgive
Cause I know that it will set me free
But all that's left is the emptiness inside of me
You murder my heart
Broke my just and watch me fade away
Now I see, now I see
That you just as broken as me

Just as broken as
Just as broken as
Just as broken as
You're just as broken as me

[?]

I will forgive, forgive
Cause I know that it will set me free
But all that's left is the emptiness inside of me
You murder my heart
Broke my just and watch me fade away
Now I see, now I see
That you just as broken as me

You're just as broken as me
You're just as broken as me
You're just as broken as me
