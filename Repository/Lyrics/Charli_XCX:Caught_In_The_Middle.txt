Caught In The Middle 
Charli XCX

[Intro x2]
Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love

[Verse:]
Took a plane at five, flew across the world, I'm the other girl
The one who's in your head
Laid there by your side in the city lights, naked in the lights
Hiding secrets in your bed

[Chorus:]
Cuz we try to turn around but we can't stop it now
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
You're stuck on my mind push restart then press rewind
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love...

[Verse 2:]
Lost inside the line, stare across the room, almost falling thru
Never made the same mistake harder every time
Wish we could be true, always wanted you
Got to stay a mystery

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of...

[Chorus:]
Cuz we try to turn around but we can't stop it now
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
You're stuck on my mind push restart then press rewind
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love...

[Bridge x2]
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of...
Cuz we all are caught in the middle, caught in the middle of...
Cuz we all are caught in the middle, caught in the middle of...

[Chorus:]
Cuz we try to turn around but we can't stop it now
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
You're stuck on my mind push restart then press rewind
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love...
