Take Over 
Nick Jonas

I can tell that you're a real bad girl
Underneath it all
You never want to let me see the dark side
Go and let it show
This is a lonely chance
Let it happen
Ok, hatch me if you can

Let your money talk
Dirty thoughts for me
Take over, take over
Like a crazy drug
You take over me

Na na na na na
Na na na na na

Take over
Take over
Take over
