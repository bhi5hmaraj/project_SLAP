A Little More 
Kaskade

Blue road, half a mile, distant wind from a eastern smile,
Long journey, is that all I can get?

Blue road, half a mile, hear me out for a little while,
Flash in the eye, I can't forget...

Little more, little more, little more, little more lovin' [2x]
Give me a little more, little more, little more, little more lovin' [2x]

Blue road, almost fine, waved goodbye now I'm a faded line,
This memory, isn't all that I get...

Tell me, "I'm Fine", echoing through a clouded mind,
Please wake me up, so I won't forget...

Little more, little more, little more, little more lovin' [2x]
Give me a little more, little more, little more, little more lovin' [2x]
