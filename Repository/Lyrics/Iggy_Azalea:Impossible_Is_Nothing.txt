Impossible Is Nothing 
Iggy Azalea

[Verse:]
Never quit until the clock stops
Never die out until your heart drops
Success will separate you from the have nots
And have all these haters at your neck like an ascot
You could do it too young world
I remember bring exactly like you young girl
But wait, you could do it too young man
See you'll be fine as long as on your own two you stand

[Hook:]
Keep on living, keep on breathing
Even when you don't believe it
Keep on climbing, keep on reaching
Even when this world can't see it
No Impossible is nothing
Even when you don't believe it
Impossible is nothing
Even when this world can't see it
Impossible is nothing

[Verse 2:]
Got to hate not have a morning you'd love to obtain it
Your future is round the corner so close you can almost taste it
It get worse before its better, that storm you gone have to weather
Either be a busted pipe or a diamond due to this pressure
25 hours 8 days out the week
Focus, keep eyes open victory never sleeps
My prayers for you is that you hit all them goals you trynna reach
I even hope at one point you take it farther then me

[Hook:]
Keep on living, keep on breathing
Even when you don't believe it
Keep on climbing, keep on reaching
Even when this world can't see it
No Impossible is nothing
Even when you don't believe it
Impossible is nothing
Even when this world can't see it
Impossible is nothing

[Bridge:]
I shall never let them see me sweat
Promise to want for more till my very last breath
Promise to blaze a path and leave a trail for the next
And never sell out my soul for a number on a cheque

I shall never let them see me sweat
Promise to want for more till my very last breath
Promise to blaze a path and leave a trail for the next
Just promise me when I'm gone you won't forget

[Hook:]
Keep on living, keep on breathing
Even when you don't believe it
Keep on climbing, keep on reaching
Even when this world can't see it
No Impossible is nothing
Even when you don't believe it
Impossible is nothing
Even when this world can't see it
Impossible is nothing
