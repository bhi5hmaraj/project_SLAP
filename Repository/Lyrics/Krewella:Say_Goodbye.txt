Say Goodbye 
Krewella

This can't be how it ends
Wasted in ignorance
The bullets in your breath
Are all I know, all I know
I'll never comprehend
Why you left me for dead
Promises broke and bent
I'm all alone, all alone

One more word before I break
Look before you fall from grace
Read my lips and shut your face
Maybe you're the one to blame
Same old story every day
Trip and fall and run away
The truth is gonna find you
It's burning up inside you

It still kills me
That I can't change things
But I'm still dreaming
I'll rewrite the ending
So you'll take back the lies
Before we say our goodbyes, say our goodbyes

The demons in your head
Whispering sweet revenge
The hands around your neck
Take control, take control
My fingers on the ledge
Slipping with every threat
I won't succumb to this
So let me go, let me go

It still kills me
That I can't change things
But I'm still dreaming
I'll rewrite the ending
So you'll take back the lies
Before we say our goodbyes, say our goodbyes

One more word before I break
Look before you fall from grace
Read my lips and shut your face
Maybe you're the one to blame
Same old story every day
Trip and fall and run away
The truth is gonna find you
Life is gonna fuck you

It still kills me
That I can't change things
But I'm still dreaming
I'll rewrite the ending
So you'll take back the lies
Before we say our goodbyes
Good, good, goodbye
