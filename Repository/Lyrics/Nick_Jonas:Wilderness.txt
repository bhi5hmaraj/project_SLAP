Wilderness 
Nick Jonas

Gotta have it
The feeling, you give me, it's savage
But why do we all gotta make it complicated
A modest overrated
Can we take it? Take it back to basics?
Oh, we can rob it, we're the moon and the stars up above us
Like a million of years, before we ever got together
A pretty story treasure
Can we take it? Take it back to basics?
Oh yeah

Naked as the day we were born
Did you know it could feel like this? Feel like this?
I'll take your body back, take it back, take it back to the wilderness
The wilderness
Let's take it back,
Let's take it back

Before the fire
We discovered desire
There's no use so you can just let me hear you breathing
Or I'll overheat it

Can we take it? Take it back to basics?
Oh yeah

Naked as the day we were born
Did you know it could feel like this? Feel like this?
I'll take your body back, take it back, take it back to the wilderness
The wilderness
Let's take it back,
Let's take it back

I'll take it back
Oh no no
Take it back
Take it back
I'll take it back
Take it back
I'll take it back
We'll take it back

Naked as the day we were born
Did you know it could feel like this? Feel like this?
I'll take your body back, take it back, take it back to the wilderness
The wilderness
Let's take it back,
Let's take it back

Let's take it back
