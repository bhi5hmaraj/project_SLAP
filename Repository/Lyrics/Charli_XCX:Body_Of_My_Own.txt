Body Of My Own 
Charli XCX

[Verse 1]
You're so damn cold
You got no feeling
I want my blood hotter
Not satisfied
I need to taste it
Your sex is so over

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Got the gun in my hand and I point it straight
To the target and I'm gonna blow my brains
I don't need you, my touch is better
I'm rolling much hotter

[Chorus]
Lights out, I'm on
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
Cause I can make it feel just like I'm hanging on
Yeah, I can do it better when I'm all alone
Lights out, so high
All alone
I got a body of my own

[Verse 2]
I'm in control
My hands are shaking
My skin's getting wetter
I'm coming close
It's overloaded
I walk in with fire

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Spin around in my head, I'm screaming out
But with you in the room I can never shout
This heroin, I'm sinking so deep
Wish I could stay here forever

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Lights out
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
Cause I'm gone
