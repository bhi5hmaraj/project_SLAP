Solitaire 
Marina And The Diamonds

[Verse 1]
Don't wanna talk anymore
I'm obsessed with silence
I go home and I lock my door
I can hear the sirens
I see buildings and bars from the window
And I listen to the wind blow
I see people and cars covered in gold
And I'm happy to be on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
Hard like a rock, cold like a stone
White like a diamond, black like coal
Cut like a jewel, yeah I repair
Myself when you're not there

[Chorus]
Solitaire
Something you consider
Rare
I don't wanna be compared
With that cheap shimmer and glitter
Solitaire

[Verse 2]
I'm in love with ice blue grey skies of England
I'll admit all I wanna do is get drunk and silent
Watch my life unfold all around me
Like a beautiful garden
I see flowers so tall they surround me
Oh my heart, it became so hardened

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And all the other jewels around me
They astounded me at first
I covered up my heart in boundaries
And all the fakes they called me cursed
But I'm not cursed, I'm not cursed
I was just covered in the dirt

[Chorus]
