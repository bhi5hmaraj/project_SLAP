These Days 
Take That

Oh I can see the future coming to you
Cry away the sadness in your eyes
And I can find a faith in days I've wasted
Been around enough to feel alive
And when the world is broken, hard and cold and
No one ever knows the reason why
For the ones we may become
For the battles we have won
For the day we reach the sun
Gonna play it loud tonight

When you dream of a dream
And you live in the world
Every hope is a hope for the best and won't you rest on my bones
And you're calling me now
I was here all the time
Should be out there living the life and not just watching oh

Take me back
Before we all explode
Before we turn to stone
Before the night is gone
Take me back
To where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before they take us over

Tonight
We're gonna live for
We're gonna live for these days
Tonight
We'll remember
We'll remember these days

What a day to believe
To believe in the night
What a day to belong, to a face in the crowd and the beat of your heart
And I',m already in
And you're working it out
And you're holding us all in your hands, oh want you waiting for

Take me back
Before we lose control
Before the tables turn
Before we break it all
Take me back
To where it all began
To where our memories grow
Before they take us over

Tonight
We're gonna live for
We're gonna live for these days
Tonight
We'll remember
We'll remember these days

Oh I can see the future coming to you
Cry away the sadness in your eyes
And I can find a faith in days I've wasted
Been around enough to feel alive
And when the world is broken, hard and cold and
No one ever knows the reason why
For the ones we may become
For the battles we have won
For the day we reach the sun
Gonna play it loud tonight

Tonight
We're gonna live for
We're gonna live for these days
Tonight
We'll remember
We'll remember these days

Tonight
We're gonna live for
We're gonna live for these days
Tonight
We'll remember
We'll remember these days

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
These days
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
These days
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
These days
