No Role Modelz 
J Cole

[J. Cole]
For Ville
Listen even when we was broke my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
Talk to a n*gga

[Chorus]
One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame n*ggas can't tell the difference
One time for a n*gga who knows
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

[J. Cole]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to
