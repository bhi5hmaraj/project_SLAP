The Bitter End 
Falling In Reverse

Let that fall

Lost for a moment in the dark
Then take my life as you say

Here I go standing on the edge
Holding on to the bitter end
This is it
This is me
With the weight of the whole world on my shoulders again

As I looked up to the sky
All the pain that is in my eyes
All the things that you don't see
But you best believe that it's haunting me

It's like a nightmare

Here I go standing on the edge
Holding on to the bitter end
This is it
This is me
With the weight of the whole world on my shoulders again

As I looked up to the sky
All the pain that is in my eyes
Some things that you don't see
But you best believe that it's haunting me

I'm afraid, I'm afraid
This is what I can't be
Get away, get away
I just wanna be happy

I'm afraid, I'm afraid
This is what I can't be
Get away, get away
I just wanna be happy

Set sail on a voyage unknown
Aboard a vessel that I call my soul
Searching for what makes me whole
Sinking in the ocean in an empty boat

Set sail on a voyage unknown
Aboard a vessel that I call my soul
Searching for what makes me whole
Sinking in the ocean in an empty boat

Here I go standing on the edge
Holding on to the bitter end
This is it
This is me
With the weight of the whole world on my shoulders again

As I looked onto the sky
All the pain that is in your eyes
Some things that you don't see
But you best believe that it's haunting me
It's haunting me
