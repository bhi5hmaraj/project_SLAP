Can It Be You? 
North Of Nine

[Verse 1]
I don't want it like the last time
When you took it and you broke mine
Oh baby you got what I need

Insanity in an open room
It's just me me and you
But oh baby you what I need

[Pre-Chorus]
I need someone to love me
Cause I'm burning alive
Need someone to hold me
Cause I'm losing my mind

[Chorus]
I don't need a crush
I don't need a touch
It ain't never enough
Can you help me?
I need someone to love me
Can it be you?
Can it be you?
Can it be you?

I try my best to punch you first
But all you gave me baby was your worst
But oh baby baby you got what I need

And I'm beggin' please
I'm beggin' please

[Pre-Chorus]
I need someone to love me
Cause I'm burning alive
Need someone to hold me
Cause I'm losing my mind

[Chorus]
I don't need a crush
I don't need a touch
It ain't never enough
Can you help me?
I need someone to love me
Can it be you?
Can it be you?
Can it be you?

I really need someone
Someone to love me
Not to just leave me here alone

I really need someone
Someone to hold me
Don't you forget me no

[Pre-Chorus]
I need someone to love me
Cause I'm burning alive
Need someone to hold me
Cause I'm losing my mind

[Chorus]
I don't need a crush
I don't need a touch
It ain't never enough
Can you help me?
I need someone to love me
Can it be you?
Can it be you?
Can it be you?

[Pre-Chorus]
I need someone to love me
Cause I'm burning alive
Need someone to hold me
Cause I'm losing my mind

[Chorus]
I don't need a crush
I don't need a touch
It ain't never enough
Can you help me?
I need someone to love me
Can it be you?
Can it be you?
Can it be you?
Can it be you?
