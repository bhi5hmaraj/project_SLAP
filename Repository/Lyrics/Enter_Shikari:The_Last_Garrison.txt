The Last Garrison 
Enter Shikari

Can you hear the war-cry?

The adrenaline bursts through the riverbanks.
Welcome to the skirmish.
I can't feel my legs!
Give me morphine,
Give me morphine,
Give me more!

No doubt,
This is a tragedy for all,
But it ain't over yet.
Heads up and thank fuck you're still alive!

Still air in my lungs,
Still blood in my veins.
We're part of the last garrison.
Still alive.
There's still air in my lungs,
Still blood in my veins.
We're part of the last garrison.

I wanna lie here and soak up the sun
But do not alight here, you cannot outrun
"This could be the end," he said, "the end my child."
So I made good use of my face and I smiled

Can you hear the war-cry?

The epinephrine blasts through the barriers.
Welcome to the skirmish.
I can't feel my arms.
Give me opium,
Give me opium,
Give me hope!

No doubt,
This is a tragedy for all,
But it ain't over yet.
Head's up and thank fuck you're still alive!

Still air in my lungs,
Still blood in my veins.
We're part of the last garrison.
Still alive.
There's still air in my lungs,
Still blood in my veins.
We're part of the last garrison.

I wanna lie here and soak up the sun
But do not alight here, you cannot outrun
âThis could be the end,â he said, âthe end my child.â
So I made good use of my face and I smiled

Let's toast to the fact we got this far
