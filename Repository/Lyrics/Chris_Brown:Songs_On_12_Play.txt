Songs On 12 Play 
Chris Brown

[Verse:]
You're a goddess in the bedroom
Devil in the skintights
Tried my best to please you
Show you what it means to
Be a victim of love
So turn on that red light
Oh
Turn on that red light
Ooh, eh

[Hook:]
We gon' be bumping and grinding
Seems like you're ready to s** me, baby, baby
And I'm feeling on your booty, driving me crazy
Half on [?] baby
Cause' your body's calling me
And with your permission let me start your ignition
Don't you know that you're reminding me
Of a song on 12 play
You're like a song on 12 play

[Trey Songz]
Do you mind if I stroke you
Baby girl, imagine that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh - just like that
Fiesta, fiesta
Naked, shaking
Etcetera, et cetera, et cetera
Hey baby

[Hook:]
We gon' be bumping and grinding
Seems like you're ready to s** me, baby, baby
And I'm feeling on your booty, driving me crazy
Half on [?] baby
Cause' your body's calling me
And with your permission let me start your ignition
Don't you know that you're reminding me
Of a song on 12 play
You're like a song on 12 play

[Bridge:]
Damn right, I'ma eat that pussy

[Verse 3:]
Baby turn on the red light tonight
Lil' mama, it'll be alright
I just wanna be all on you
Do it 'til we both can't move
Your body
Your ass, girl
Sweat dripping on your body
So tonight

[Hook:]
We gon' be bumping and grinding
Seems like you're ready to s** me, baby, baby
And I'm feeling on your booty, driving me crazy
Half on [?] baby
Cause' your body's calling me
And with your permission let me start your ignition
Don't you know that you're reminding me
Of a song on 12 play
You're like a song on 12 play

Oh na na na na na na, down low, down low
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby
Keep it on the down low, down low
