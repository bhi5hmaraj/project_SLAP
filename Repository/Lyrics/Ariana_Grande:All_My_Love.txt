All My Love 
Ariana Grande

Baby, don't you know you've got all my love, all my love
Baby, don't you know you've got all my love, all my love

Hold up, wait
Before you go, just stay
And talk to me for a little
Baby, won't you loosen up just a little, eh?

See what you don't understand
Is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that I'll never fall in love, ever fall in love again
Cause' you give me chill, everytime we chill
I spend all of my days, doing doing

Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you baby
Boy, you've got all my time
I'm lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin' I'm lovin' you baby
Boy you got all my, all my
Love and affection, all of my attention
You don't gotta question if I'm really
Lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin' I'm lovin' you baby
Boy you got all my, all my

Hold up, wait
Shut up and kiss me, babe
I just wanna give a little taste
I just wanna give a little taste before you go

See what you don't understand
Is fallin' in love wasn't part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that I'll never fall in love, ever fall in love again
Cause' you give me chills, everytime we chill
I spend all of my days, doing doing

Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you baby
Boy, you've got all my time
I'm lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin' I'm lovin' you baby
Boy you got all my, all my
Love and affection, all of my attention
You don't gotta question if I'm really
Lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin' I'm lovin' you baby
Boy you got all my, all my

Time and my trust, don't mess this up
You got me falling in love, you got me falling in love
You got me falling so
Boy you change the way I breathe, when you put your lips on me
I adore you
So let me make it clear to you that boy you're all I need
My baby

Nothin' but lovin' you, nothin' but lovin' you baby
Boy, you've got all my time
I'm lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin' I'm lovin' you baby
Boy you got all my, all my
Love and affection, all of my attention
You don't gotta question if I'm really
Lovin' your lovin', I'm lovin' I'm lovin' you baby

Baby, don't you know you've got all my love, all my love
Baby, don't you know you've got all my love, all my love
