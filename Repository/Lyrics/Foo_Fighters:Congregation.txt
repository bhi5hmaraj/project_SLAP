Congregation 
Foo Fighters

[Verse:]
Well, I met the seventh son
Who came for everyone
The day he heard the lighting in the field
I heard him clear his throat
The fork within the road
That night the Tallahatchie took the wheel

[Pre-Hook:]
I've been throwing knives
To see just where they land
Now my world is in your hands

[Hook:]
Send in the congregation
Open your eyes, step in the light
A jukebox generation
Just as you were

[Verse 2:]
The voice upon the stage
âIs the heart inside a cage
And they're singing like a bluebird in the round
There's mystery in this word
And ghosts within these woods
And ghosts within these roots

[Pre-Hook:]
That are tangled deep beneath this southern ground
I've been going through life
Making foolish plans
Now my world is in your hands

[Hook:]
Send in the congregation
Open your eyes, step in the light
A jukebox generation
Just as you were

[Bridge:]
And you need blind faith
âNo false hope, no false hope
âDo you have blind faith?
âNo false hope, no false hope
âWhere is your blind faith?
âNo false hope, no false hope
âOpen your eyes, open your eyes
âStep into the light
âOpen your eyes, step into the light

[Outro:]
âThe sound becomes congregation
A congregation, a congregation, yeah
And they're singing like a bluebird in the round
