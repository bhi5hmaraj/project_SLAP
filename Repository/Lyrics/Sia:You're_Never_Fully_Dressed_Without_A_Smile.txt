You're Never Fully Dressed Without A Smile 
Sia

[Verse 1:]
Hey, America, let's turn it up, yeah check out yourselves
Cause you know you're never fully dressed without a smile
Your clothes may be Chanel, Gucci, your shoes crocodile
But baby, you're never fully dressed without a smile

[Chorus:]
And if you stand for nothing you'll fall for it all
We got all we need, got diamonds
But never fully dressed without a smile
And if you stand for something, you can have it all
If it's real, you'll open every door
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile

[Verse 2:]
Ready or not, give all we've got, yeah you can't deny
That baby, you're never fully dressed without a smile
Don't sink the boat when you lose hope, I'll keep you alive
But baby, you're never fully dressed without a smile

[Chorus:]
And if you stand for nothing you'll fall for it all
We got all we need, got diamonds
But never fully dressed without a smile
And if you stand for something, you can have it all
If it's real, you'll open every door
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile

[Verse 3:]
Now look at us, we pick up, we set it on fire
Cause you know you're never fully dressed without a smile
We show it out, we're playing now, we're living the life
But baby, you're never fully dressed without a smile

[Chorus:]
And if you stand for nothing you'll fall for it all
We got all we need, got diamonds
But never fully dressed without a smile
And if you stand for something, you can have it all
If it's real, you'll open every door
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile

You're never fully dressed without a smile
