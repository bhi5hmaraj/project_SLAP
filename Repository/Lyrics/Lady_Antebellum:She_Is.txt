She Is 
Lady Antebellum

[Verse:]
She hails from Boston, she hates the sounds of goodbyes, wait
She loves some days in champagne
She can't stand the winter
She can't stand anything that she can't change, all that she can't change

[Chorus:]
She is whatever she wants to be
She is a little of everything
Mixed up, so tough in a beautiful way
She's got the world in her fingertips
And she makes good(?) look effortless
And I want everything she is
She is, she is
I want everything she is

[Verse 2:]
When we talk for hour
And she wrote the book on how to get nowhere
Don't matter what I say
I could buy her flowers
That's just too cliche to impress
A girl like her, but you know I kinda like it that way

[Chorus:]
She is whatever she wants to be
She is a little of everything
Mixed up, so tough in a beautiful way
She's got the world in her fingertips
And she makes good(?) look effortless
And I want everything she is
She is, she is
I want everything she is

[Bridge:]
All I think about and I can't do without
The good, the bad, the somewhere in between
Oh, cuz I want everything she is

[Chorus:]
She is whatever she wants to be
She is a little of everything
Mixed up, so tough in a beautiful way
She's got the world in her fingertips
And she makes good(?) look effortless
And I want everything she is
She is, she is
I want everything she is
