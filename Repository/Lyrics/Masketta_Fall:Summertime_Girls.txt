Summertime Girls 
Masketta Fall

Holding onto the summertime baby
It's all we got
With the bikinis out til the sun goes down
You know I can't get enough

I see the summertime girls and fall in love
I got my heart upon my sleeve

And when the shirts come off the people stop,
No I just can't believe

Them summertime girls, they drive me crazy
I think I'm in love
They're looking so good, they're so amazing
Like da-da-daa-da-da
They got the sunkissed skin and golden curls
Smiling at the world
Them summertime girls, they drive me crazy
It's all about them summertime girls
Them summertime girls,
It's about them summertime girls

I wait all year for the summertime,
I love the way they dance
When the sun comes up the beach is out,
Said I gotta take my chance

Follow me to the good times honey,
Yeah here we go
Cause it won't take long til the summer's gone
And we might just never know

Them summertime girls, they drive me crazy
I think I'm in love
They're looking so good, they're so amazing
Like da-da-daa-da-da
They got the sunkissed skin and golden curls
Smiling at the world
Them summertime girls, they drive me crazy
It's all about them summertime girls
Them summertime girls,
It's about

In the summertime we'll stay,
Cause tomorrow's on it's way
Let's do this now,
Like woooooah

Holding to the summertime baby,
It's all we got,
It's all I want

Them summertime girls, they drive me crazy
I think I'm in love
They're looking so good, they're so amazing
Like da-da-daa-da-da
They got the sunkissed skin and golden curls
Smiling at the world
Them summertime girls, they drive me crazy
It's all about them summertime girls
Them summertime girls,
It's about them summertime girls
