I Know You 
Skylar Grey

[Verse 1]
I believe, I believe there's love in you
Grid locked on the dusty avenues,
Inside your heart, just afraid to go
I am more, I am more then innocent
But just take a chance and let me in
And I'll show you ways, that you don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't complicate it,
Don't let the past dictate
Yeaaah!
I have been patience
But slowly I'm losing faith

[Chorus]
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby

[Verse 2]
I believe, I believe you could love me
But you're lost on a road to misery
And what I gave to you
I can never get back!
Don't complicate it
Don't drive yourself insane
Yeaaah!
Say what you will but I know that you want to stay!

[Chorus]
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby

[Bridge]
Chemicals rushing in,
I know it's you that I belong to
I'm fighting like a cannonball in the air
Crushing into who I belong to
Uuuh uh, uuuuh uuuuh uh

I have been patience
But slowly I'm losing faith

[Chorus 2]
Please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
Please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
(The shadows of your heart
Are hanging in the sheets, waiting)
I know you baby, I know you baby
The secrets that you hide, come drown us
And it's just like)
I know you baby, I know you baby

[Outro]
The shadows of your heart
Are hanging in the sheets, waiting
I know you baby, I know you baby
The secrets that you hide, come drown us
And it's just like
I know you baby, I know you baby
