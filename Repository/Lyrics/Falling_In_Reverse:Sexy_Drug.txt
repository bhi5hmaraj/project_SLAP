Sexy Drug 
Falling In Reverse

Sexy girl I just fell in love
You should try it it's a hell of a drug
Like OMG you make me
Com-com-complete

Iâm looking for reasons
I'm begging and pleading
Iâm dreaming calling you mine
You keep me st-st-st-st-studdering
Stumbling, fumbling over my lines
Without you girl I'm not alright
I'm not okay

No, don't give up on me
Wait, it's not what it seems
Now we canât stop this tragedy
And it's back to the start
Yeah, yeah
And we're falling apart
Yeah, yeah

Sexy girl come and lie with me
Frustrated and it's sexually
Like OMG you make me
Com-com-complete

Iâm just being honest
Weâre creeping and crawling
I'm kissing the top of your head
We're rocking and rolling
Weâre touching and moaning
And making a mess in your bed
Can someone help?
She shot me dead
I canât be saved
Yeah!

No, don't give up on me
Wait, it's not what it seems
Now we canât stop this tragedy

So God if you are real I need your help
(We caused this)
This girl has stolen my heart with a broken halo
And I canât deny, she's so damn vain
Give me some advice

(Instrumental)

Sexy girl I just fell in love
You should try it, it's a hell of a drug
Like OMG you make me
Com-com-complete

No, don't give up on me
Wait, it's not what it seems
Now we canât stop this tragedy
It's back to the start
No, don't give up on me
Wait, it's not what it seems
Now we canât stop this tragedy
It's back to the start
And we're falling apart
And it's back to the start
And we're falling apart
Shot straight through the heart
