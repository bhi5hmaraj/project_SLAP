Bubblegum 
Jason DeRulo

Got me âbout to break my neck
Tell me how you pop like that
You do it like it ainât no sweat
I never seen a bubble so fat
You do it all day in the mirror
You practise all day in the mirror
Left cheek, right cheek, all year
Iâm calling you out, and I hope you hear it

Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Drop a dollar on the floor
Hope she give it to you
A ghetto booty
A ghetto booty
She got that trunk but she donât look back
She put it in reverse and I canât be mad
I canât be mad at that baby fat
Thatâs a ghetto booty, a ghetto booty

She just wanna pop that bubblegum
She just wanna pop that bubblegum
If she keep blinding, might explode
Never seen a girl like you before
She just wanna pop that bubblegum

Oh yeah

You do it like a professional
But you point your own schedule
Look youâre so pretty in pain
Acting like a shit donât stain
You do it all day in the mirror
You practise all day in the mirror
Left cheek, right cheek, all year
Iâm calling you out, and I hope you hear it

Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Drop a dollar on the floor
Hope she give it to you
A ghetto booty
A ghetto booty
She got that trunk but she donât look back
She put it in reverse and I canât be mad
I canât be mad at that baby fat
Thatâs a ghetto booty, a ghetto booty

She just wanna pop that bubblegum
She just wanna pop that bubblegum
If she keep blinding, might explode
Never seen a girl like you before
She just wanna pop that bubblegum

Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Shawty right there got a ghetto booty
Drop a dollar on the floor
Hope she give it to you
A ghetto booty
A ghetto booty
She got that trunk but she donât look back
She put it in reverse and I canât be mad
I canât be mad at that baby fat
Thatâs a ghetto booty, a ghetto booty

She just wanna pop that bubblegum
She just wanna pop that bubblegum
If she keep blinding, might explode
Never seen a girl like you before
She just wanna pop that bubblegum

She just wanna pop
She just wanna pop that bubblegum
She just wanna pop that bubblegum

If she keep blinding, might explode
Never seen a girl like you before
She just wanna pop that bubblegum

Oh yeah
