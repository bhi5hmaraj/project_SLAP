West Coast 
Lana Del Rey

Down on the West Coast they got a sayin'
If you're not drinkin' then you're not playin'.
But you've got the music,
You've got the music in you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast I get this feeling
Like it all could happen that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment,
You for the moment, Boy Blue, yeah, you

You're flyin' high at push on,
I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you miss me, and I say
I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet,
I'm alive I'm a lush
Your love, your love, your love

I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love

I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo lala
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)

Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigon
And you've got the music,
You've got the music in you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and rock and roll groupies
And you've got the music,
You've got the music in you, don't you?

You push it hard, I pull away,
I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cariÃ±o, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, your love

I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love

I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo lala
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love

I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo lala
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
