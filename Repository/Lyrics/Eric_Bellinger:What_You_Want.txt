What You Want 
Eric Bellinger

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
I would never hurt you
I would never do that no
But if I ever hurt you
Wouldn't be intentional ,no
All I wanna do is make you smile
All I wanna do is settle down
With you and nobody else
Ain't that what you want to hear
Ain't that what you want to hear
We can go where you wanna
Do what you wanna
Whatever you wanna
Anything you wanna

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
Ain't that what you want to hear
Ain't that what you want to hear
âCause if that's the case girl
We can settle this right now
Baby if I had you
Tell me what would I need with somebody else
I do whatever I gotta do to get you to myself
Girl If I had you
Tell me what would I need with somebody else
I do whatever I gotta do to keep you to myself
Ain't that what you want?
Sounds good (I bet it do)
Sounds good (girl it's supposed to)
Sounds perfect baby
It sounds alright with me (I'm glad it sounds alright)
Sounds good (to you)
Sounds good
Sounds perfect baby
It sounds alright with me

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
If you say yes girl
I would never lead you on
I would tell the world
When I wanna keep it on the low
All I wanna do is make you smile
All I wanna do is settle down
With you and nobody else

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Eric Bellinger]

Baby if you do me right
I would never do you wrong
If I give you my heart
Boy don't break it
Girl I treat you right
I'll never do you wrong
If you give me your heart
I won't ever break it

[Bridge]
