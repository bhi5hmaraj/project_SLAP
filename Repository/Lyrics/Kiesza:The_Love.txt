The Love 
Kiesza

[Chorus:]
This is the love, something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough, and I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
This is the love, something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough, and I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind

[Interlude:]
Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah
Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, baby, baby
Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah
Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, baby, baby

I'm so close to take you far away
I don't know who'd better feel the?
All eyes closed, and make my heart awake
I just know that you're one hell of a love

Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, shadows on the ceilin'
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, can't ignore it

[Chorus:]
This is the love, something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough, and I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
This is the love, something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough, and I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind

[Interlude:]
Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah
Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, baby, baby
Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah
Yeah, ah-ye-aye-e-yeah, baby, baby

I don't want to waste another day
Off my toes, don't think I never wanna land
I feel you in every single way
I just know that you're one hell of a love

Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, shadows on the ceilin'
Oh-woah-oh, oh-woah-oh, can't ignore it

[Chorus:]
This is the love, something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough, and I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
This is the love, something you can feel but you can't define
Can't get enough, and I don't wanna leave what we can't rewind
