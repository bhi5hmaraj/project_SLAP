Jetlag 
DENA

I'm feeling kind of busy, things are out of control
Always when you're leaving it begins to feel wrong
It's like I'm losing the powers of all the things around me in my head

It's such a [?], only thing I can't think if it's you, yeah
Only thing I can't think if it's you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus:]
Wondering cause I haven't been taking any planes today
You're the one who is away and I'm the one who stays
Wondering cause I haven't been taking any planes today
You're the one who is away and I'm the one who stays

[Chorus:]
I think I'm having jet lag without even having fun
Time is moving in a strange way and I don't know why
Must have somehting to do with the fact that you are not around
Ain't no point to ask a doctor, I know that I'm feeling down
I'm feeling down, I know that I'm feeling down
I'm feeling down, I know that I'm feeling down
I'm feeling down, I know that I'm feeling down
I'm feeling down, I know that I'm feeling down

I'm looking under my seat there's no emergency kit
I try to keep it cool, maybe I should work to move it, but how?
And time goes by so slow, I shouldn't have let you go (Hell, no)
I'm hanging all alone in this [?] wrong time zone

[Pre-Chorus:]
Wondering cause I haven't been taking any planes today
You're the one who is away and I'm the one who stays
Wondering cause I haven't been taking any planes today
You're the one who is away and I'm the one who stays still

[Chorus:]
I think I'm having jet lag without even having fun
Time is moving in a strange way and I don't know why
Must have something to do with the fact that you are not around
Ain't no point to ask a doctor, I know that I'm feeling down
I'm feeling down, I know that I'm feeling down
I'm feeling down, I know that I'm feeling down
I'm feeling down, I know that I'm feeling down
I'm feeling down, I know that I'm feeling down

[Chorus:]
I think I'm having jet lag without even having fun
Time is moving in a strange way and I don't know why
Must have something to do with the fact that you are not around
Ain't no point to ask a doctor, I know that I'm feeling down (ain't no point)

[Chorus:]
I think I'm having jet lag without even having fun (ain't no point, ain't no
point, ain't no point, ain't no point)
Time is moving in a strange way and I don't know why (ain't no point, ain't no
point, ain't no point, ain't no point)
Must have something to do with the fact that you are not around (ain't no
point, ain't no point, ain't no point, ain't no point)
Ain't no point to ask a doctor, I know that I'm feeling down (ain't no point,
ain't no point, ain't no point, ain't no point)
