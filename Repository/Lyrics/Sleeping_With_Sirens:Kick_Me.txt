Kick Me 
Sleeping With Sirens

[Verse 1]
Let's hang the jury, you sick judgmental fools!
I'll bury you six feet deep, so tired of your rules.
Fuck you and your opinion, how could you be so blind?
What goes around comes back around in time.

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know shit, you don't know shit about me.
You don't know shit, shit, shit,
Don't know a goddamn thing about me!

[Chorus]
Keep looking down on me, I am more then you'll ever be (more then you'll ever
be).
Cut me deep but I won't bleed,
You're gonna kick, kick, kick me when I'm down!
And by all means put me through hell and I'll make you see,
That I'm the opposite of hate.
Try to kick, kick, kick me when I'm down!
Kick me when I'm down, wooh!

[Verse 2]
Of all the sinners, you're first in line (you're first in line),
So go to hell and tell the devil I'm not that far behind.
Fuck you and your decision, cause it's not mine,
What goes around comes back around in time.

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know shit, you don't know shit about me.
You don't know shit, shit, shit,
Don't know a goddamn thing about me!

[Chorus]
Keep looking down on me, I am more then you'll ever be.
Cut me deep but I won't bleed,
You're gonna kick, kick, kick me when I'm down!
And by all means put me through hell and I'll make you see,
That I'm the opposite of hate.
Try to kick, kick, kick me when I'm down!

[Hook]
Woah oh woah oh woah oh,
Your gonna kick, kick, kick me when I'm down!
Woah oh woah oh woah oh,
Kick, kick, kick me when I'm down.

[Outro]
Woaaaah yeah!
Kick me when I'm down,
Kick me when I'm down, down, down,
Kick me when I'm down, down, down,
Kick me when I'm down!
