Intertwine 
Lil Twist

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
What's the use to being lonely [?]
When I'm offering my company
You could be my lover, hold me
I'll give you attention all night, all day
Intertwine, we can intertwine
We should make some sign
So I can intertwine, with you

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
Had the whole hood shook when you moved in
Face like a goddess, body on ten
Had to be back in the crib before the streets lights
That was back when you wouldn't like to have friends
Now you growing up up
Seen you at the club had me like hold up
What you doing', who you with, what you sippin' on? (sipping on)
Who you doing, where you being, let me take you home
And if you want we can stop at the Waffle House
I'm on the shit it's whatever that you talking 'bout
Take that time to get to know me
Cause baby what's the use of being lonely?

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
What's the use to being lonely [?]
When I'm offering my company
You could be my lover, hold me
I'll give you attention all night, all day
Intertwine, we can intertwine
We should make some sign
So I can inrtertwine with you

[Verse 2: Lil Twist]
We could intertwine, just let me get behind
And watch me run up in this thing like the finish line
To end it like it's Christmas time
I eat it like it's been a time
She said let's do it like at 86
I said let's do it like 69
the way she getting tired
Introduced to the money now she's and she's wired
Getting back to the she said Twizzy so I desire
Let's get in the shower girl that ass is on fire
I play you in the kitchen the wire
That shit don't need as long as love transpires
And after all that, baby you should really know me
Now you ain't got never be lonely

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
What's the use to being lonely [?]
When I'm offering my company
You could be my lover, hold me
I'll give you attention all night, all day
Intertwine, we can intertwine
We should make some sign
So I can intertwine, with you

[Bridge]
Tell me do you really want it [?]
Wake up in the morning
Right next to you baby, right next to you baby

Tell me do you really want it?
Wake up in the morning
Right next to you baby, right next to you baby

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
What's the use to being lonely [?]
When I'm offering my company
You could be my lover, hold me
I'll give you attention all night, all day
Intertwine, we can intertwine
We should make some sign
So I can intertwine, with you
