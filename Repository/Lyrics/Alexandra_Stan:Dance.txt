Alexandra Stan

Love all over the world
Makin' love all over the world
Ooh
Love all over the world
Makin' love all over the world
Oooh

In my dreams you're falling,
You're falling
You're falling down
I'm breaking
I'm breaking your rules
I really believe you can try
And change your ways
'Cause by the time you'll know
I'm gonna take your hand
Won't let you go
We'll lose our mind, we'll lose our mind

Why don't you dance dance dance
And with your very friends let's start a new romance
Ooh
Why don't you dance dance dance
And with your very friends let's start a new romance
Ooh
Why don't you dance
Dance dance dance dance dance

Love all over the world
Makin' love all over the world
Ooh oh oh oh

This feels lost thinking there's nothing to bring you up
I'll show you, I'll show we're no fools
I'll make you believe you can turn your life around
'Cause by the time you'll know
I'm gonna take your hand
Won't let you go,
We'll lose our mind, we'll lose our mind

Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love with friends
Let's start a new romance
Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love with friends
Let's start a new romance
Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love with friends
Let's start a new romance
Ooh oh oh
Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love with friends
Let's start a new romance
Ooh
Why don't you dance dance
Dance dance dance dance

Why don't you dance
Dance dance
And fall in love with friends
Let's start a new romance
Why don't you dance dance dance
And fall in love with friends
Let's start a new romance
