Little Toy Guns 
Carrie Underwood

[Verse 1]
In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just wouldn't stop it
Fighting at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through her tears
She's saying, she's praying.

[Chorus]
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, Just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
No smoke, no bullets, no kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

[Verse 2]
Wish there was a white flag waving or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing like shoot'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card and just turn off all the noise.

[Chorus]
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, Just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
No smoke, no bullets, no kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

[Bridge]
I wish they didn't cut like a knife
I wish they didn't break you inside
I wish they didn't bang bang make you wanna run, yeah

[Chorus]
Like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt no one, Just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
No smoke, no bullets, no shot from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Just a bang bang rolling off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Oh like little toy guns
