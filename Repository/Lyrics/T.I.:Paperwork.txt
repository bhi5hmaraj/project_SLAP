Paperwork 
T.I.

[Hook: Pharrell]
(Paperwork)
Don't do no business until you check his (paperwork)
And if all else fails, I just hope that this (paperwork)
[?] through the roof
Everything got a cost, they gone need something on you
(Paperwork)

[Verse 1: ti]
Atl, Westside, that's the only home I know
In '85, me and Uncle Quint used to ride around in the big Bronco
Took me up to [?] disco, daytime, set me down at the bar
Where I drank Shirley Temple 'til he walked out with a bag and we got back in
the car
What you wanna be he ask? When you grow up big kid?
I just wanna be like you, ridin' round town gettin' bread
We shot a couple Lac, couple summer pass,
Uncle quint ain't nowhere to be found
Later we learn that someone ratted him out,
For that reason 10 years he won't be around

[Hook: Pharrell]

[Verse 2: ti]
Picture me in '93, I'm the only man I see
Fresh up off the porch looking for the drop Porsche and the fake I'd
Introduce me to the crack game,
Rap game was the furthest from my mind
Had a notebook full of rhymes and a pocket full of crack rock dimes

[Bridge: ti]
Time on my side, lift. 45 in my jean
Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams, yessir

[Verse 3: ti]
Welfare, food stamps, section eight,
Me and Ma lived in the trap
I said fuck school, it holdin' me back
I wanna bankroll, chasin' after that

[Hook: Pharrell]

[Verse 4: ti]
Look at me at 17, livin' on my own, peddlin' quarter key
Now and then sellin' weed, tokin' too, cost my first felony
That's [?] follow, drinkin' Henney up out the bottle
Told a child I think I'm bein' followed
Family don't think I'll live to see tomorrow
Pay to have a story like mine
Not many you had a little nine
Not many and you did a little dirt
Too many did a little time
Wake up, 10 years of your life pass when you get your cake up
Don't it seem like [?] when the Feds on your ass
Passin' out

[Hook: Pharrell]

[Verse 5: Pharrell]
If you think that you high, baby look above you
It's drones in the sky,
There's nothing you could do
So left, two, three snap
Right two, three snap
Don't [?] it's too late for that
Cause they got

[Bridge: ti]

[Hook: Pharrell]
The two southern legends team up as ti talks about his life growing up over
Pharrell's beat.
