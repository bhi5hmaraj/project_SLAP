Down South 
Lady Antebellum

[Verse: Hillary Scott)
I was born, I was blessed
Right place, right time, I guess
No good reason why I left
Except to run and roam

Would you take me back and take me in
Let me be your child again?
Kiss my cheek, forgive my sins
And let me call you home?

[Pre-Chorus:]
Oh, I may stay here for awhile

[Chorus:]
If I'm gonna fly, gonna fly down south
If I'm gonna drive, I'm gonna find a small town
South is where my momma lives
Where my lil piece of heaven is
If I'm gonna dream, I'm gonna dream your face
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go to that place
And figure out what I lost and found down south

[Verse 2: Hillary Scott)
Religion and me don't always agree
But I sure love my maker
Sounds just like a gospel song
When I sing my lil prayer

Got rocks in my shoes, holes in my soul
I'm covered in dirt from head to toe
From walking around this? Road
You can follow me back to here

[Pre-Chorus:]
Oh, I may stay here for awhile

[Chorus:]
If I'm gonna fly, gonna fly down south
If I'm gonna drive, I'm gonna find a small town
South is where my momma lives
Where my lil piece of heaven is
If I'm gonna dream, I'm gonna dream your face
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go to that place
And figure out what I lost and found down south

[Bridge:]
Oooooh oh oh oh, nananana
Oooooh oh oh oh, nananana
Oh, I may stay here for awhile

[Chorus:]
If I'm gonna fly, gonna fly down south
If I'm gonna drive, I'm gonna find a small town
South is where my momma lives
Where my lil piece of heaven is
If I'm gonna dream, I'm gonna dream your face
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go to that place
And figure out what I lost and found down south
