Long Strech Of Love 
Lady Antebellum

[Verse: Charles Helley)
Your hit initial fire and ice
You're water and whisky burn
We kiss, we fight, make up all night
You're the blessing and the curse

(Hillary Scott)
But I don't ever wanna break this chain
I don't ever wanna walk away
Cuz I ain't ever gonna find another lover
Make me feel this way

[Pre-Chorus:]
Over and over and over we say that we're through
But I come right back to you

[Chorus:]
There's a long stretch of Love
Coming down the line
Have you like I want, ever rolling
Baby, you'll be mine
Have you right here, beside you
When you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of Love

[Verse 2:]
You lift me up, you bring me down
You make me feel alive
You send my heart in overdrive
Every time you kill the lights

[Pre-Chorus:]
Over and over and over we play this game
Win or lose, we never change

[Chorus:]
There's a long stretch of Love
Coming down the line
Have you like I want, ever rolling
Baby, you'll be mine
Have you right here, beside you
When you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of Love

(Solo)

[Bridge:]
Long stretch of love
Long stretch of love
Long stretch of love
Long stretch of love

[Pre-Chorus:]
Over and over and over we play this game
Win or lose, we never change

[Chorus:]
There's a long stretch of Love
Coming down the line
Have you like I want, ever rolling
Baby, you'll be mine
Have you right here, beside you
When you when these good times get tough
Baby, we're in for a long stretch of Love
