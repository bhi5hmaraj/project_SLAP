Burn The Pages 
Sia

Your dark gray like a storm cloud
Swelling up with rage thats desperate to be let out
And I know it's a heavy load carrying those tears around
Carrying those tears around
Worry make the world go round

The twisted up like a slipknot
Tied by a juice-head who just took his t-shot
And I know there's hungry dog
Tugging t your frayed ends
But he's just playing with you, he just wants to be your friend
So don't worry don't worry
I'm here by your side
By your side, by your side
We're letting go tonight

Yesterday is gone and you will be o.k.
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let them cook
Yesterday is dead and gone. And so, today
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let them cook

Eyes stinging from the black smoke
New hope, loose rope, risen from the undertow, all is well
We welcome the cry of the dark night sky
Swallow me peacefully, follow my heart back inside
So don't worry don't worry
I'm here by your side
By your side, by your side
We're letting go tonight

Yesterday is gone and you will be okay
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let them cook
Yesterday is dead and gone. And so, today
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let them cook

Don't worry don't worry
I'm here by your side
By your side, by your side
We're letting go tonight

Yesterday is gone and you will be okay
Paste your past into a book
Burn the pages, let them cook
Yesterday is dead and gone. And so, Today
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let them cook
