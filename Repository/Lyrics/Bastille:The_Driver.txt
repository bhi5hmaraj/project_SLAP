The Driver 
Bastille

[Verse:]
Shout out from the bottom of my lungs
A plague on both your houses
This thing, it's a family affair
It's drawing out my weakness

[Hook 1:]
Big boys don't cry
They don't ask why

[Hook 2:]
There was a time when a moment like this
Wouldn't ever cross my mind
The sun will rise with my name on your lips
'Cuz everything will change tonight

[Verse 2:]
I want to be back on the ground
Where my feet touch my shadow
I want to dig my heels in the dirt
Feel it right between all of my toes
Anything to stop floating on
Drag me down back down below
Take breath and push the anger down
Try to remember calmness

[Hook 1:]
Big boys don't cry
They don't ask why

[Hook 2:]
There was a time when a moment like this
Wouldn't ever cross my mind
The sun will rise with my name on your lips
'Cuz everything will change tonight

[Verse 3:]
Hey now, what's the gravity upon your face?
Aren't I the one who's bleeding?
Real men, always thinking with our fists
My turn to be the victim

[Hook 1:]
Big boys don't cry
They don't ask why

[Hook 2:]
There was a time when a moment like this
Wouldn't ever cross my mind
The sun will rise with my name on your lips
'Cuz everything will change tonight

[Hook 2:]
There was a time when a moment like this
Wouldn't ever cross my mind
The sun will rise with my name on your lips
'Cuz everything will change tonight
