The Right Stuff 
Noel Gallagher

Out of the blue I had an angel sent
Give me your soul and I'll be on my way
You and I got the right stuff
You and I got the right stuff

Are you the sleeper or the yellow soul?
Are you the devil or the ghost?
You and I got the right stuff
You and I got the right stuff
When your heart gets shattered
And your genes get framed
And you change the morning at the end of the day

When your heart gets shattered
And your genes get framed
And you change the morning at the end of the day
You and I got the right stuff
You and I got the right stuff
You and I got the right stuff
You and I
