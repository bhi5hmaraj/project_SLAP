You're Not Alone 
Owl City

Some days I barely hold on
When life drags me down
I wanna let go
But when my spirit is weak You come to my aid
And strengthen my soul

I'm lost without You
I'll never doubt You
Your grace beyond compare
And though when it rains it pours
You know all I have is Yours
You smile when you hear my prayer

You rescued me and I believe
that God is love, and He is all I need
From this day forth, for all eternity
I'll never wander on my own
For I am Yours until You call me home
I close my eyes and I can hear You say,
You're not alone
Ooh
You're not alone
Ooh

Some days I just can't go on
I stumble and fall
And I hang my head
But You reach out for my hand
And You lift me up, again and again
Ooh yes You do

I'm lost without You
Iâll never doubt You
Your grace beyond compare
And though when it rains it pours
You know all I have is Yours
You smile when you hear my prayer

You rescued me and I believe
that God is love and He is all I need
From this day forth for all eternity
I'll never wander on my own
For I am Yours until You call me home
I close my eyes and I can hear You say
You're not alone
Ooh
You're not alone
Ooh

In the face of my depravity
For God so loved the world, he taught for me
Yeah
My fire burns 'til He returns
And takes me home beyond the galaxy

You rescued me and I believe
that God is love and He is all I need
From this day forth, for all eternity (all eternity)
I'll never wander on my own
For I am Yours until You call me home
I close my eyes and I can hear You say
You're not alone
Ooh
You're not alone
Ooh
You're not alone, you're not alone
Never alone
