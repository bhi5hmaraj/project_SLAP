Tell Me It's Okay 
Paramore

[Verse 1]
Maybe its been years since I genuinely smiled
Maybe its been years since I wanted to be a part of anything
But lately I've been good you know I've actually been great
Man, I even laughed a little today, aw so strange, you're so strange

[Chorus]
Tell me its okay to be happy now, because I'm happy now
Tell me its okay to be happy now, because I'm happy now
Tell me its okay(x4)

[Verse 2]
Thought it as my right to be as sorry as I wanted to be
I wasted all my teenage years being a misery factory
But something had to give, I had to finally see light
I think at 23 its time to practice what I preach
And what I preach is:

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
All my wasted hope, I let go when I should've held tighter
And now the sun out, I let it burn not afraid of feeling shine
On me

Tell me it's okay (x8)

[Chorus]
Tell me its okay to be happy now, because I'm happy now
Tell me its okay to be happy now, my life is finally leveling out, so
Tell me its okay to be happy now, because I'm happy now
Tell me its okay to be happy now, my life is finally leveling out, so
Tell me its okay(x4)
