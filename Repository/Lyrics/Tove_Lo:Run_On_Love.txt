Run On Love 
Tove Lo

I had one mission but I committed treason
I can't believe I caved for you
So I am now a failure, everything I gave you
Let's elope and live like you

Trapped inside each other, we don't even bother
Naive, say it's a beautiful thing
'Hope we live forever' doesn't sound too clever
works as my protective wing

We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love 'til it dies
'Til it dies, again

We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love 'til it dies
'Til it dies, again

Together we fall

I had one mission but I committed treason
I promised I would stay away
From you and your bad tricks, you were my quick fix
I can feel it fade away

Suddenly the day came, we started to place blame
Driving us right out of our heads
You say it's my error, I say look in the mirror
The reason why our flame is dead

We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love 'til it dies
'Til it dies, again

We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love 'til it dies
'Til it dies

I always go back to you
I always go back
I always go back
I always go back
I always go back

Together we fall
