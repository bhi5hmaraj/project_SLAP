Can't Pin Me Down 
Marina And The Diamonds

[Intro]
You can paint me any colour
And I can be your clown
But you ain't got my number
No you can't pin me down
Yeah you can't pin me down
Yeah you can't pin me down

[Verse 1]
Now I got your back up
What do you not like
Do you think I'm stuck up
Cause I'm always picking fights
You might think I'm one thing but I am another
You can't call my bluff
Time to back off, motherfucker

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you really want me to write a feminist anthem
I'm happy cooking dinner in the kitchen for my husband
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You can paint me any colour
And I can be your clown
But you ain't got my number
No you can't pin me down
Yeah you can't pin me down
Yeah you can't pin me down

[Verse 2]
You ain't got me sussed yet
You're not even close
Baby it's the one thing
That I hate the most
All these contradictions pouring out of me
Just another girl in the 21st century

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna give you anything that you expect
You think I'm like the others
You need to get your eyes checked

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I could be your sister
I could be your mother
I could be your friend or
I could be your lover
Do you like my body
Do you like my mind
What is it that you are having trouble to define?

[Pre-Chorus]
I am never gonna give you anything you expect
You think I'm like the others, boy you need to get your eyes checked

[Chorus]
You can paint me any colour
I can be your russian doll
But you ain't got my number
No, you can't make me small
You can paint me any colour
And I can be your clown
But you ain't got my number
No you can't pin me down
Yeah you can't pin me down
Yeah you can't pin me down
