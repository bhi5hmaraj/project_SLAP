Magic 
Coldplay

Call it magic
Call it true
I call it magic, when I'm with you
And I just got broken
Broken into two
Still I call it magic, when I'm next to you

And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't
Want anybody else but you

I don't, No I don't, No I don't, No I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No I don't, No I don't, No I don't
Want anybody else but you

Ooh

Call it magic
Cut me into two
And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still, I call it magic
You're such a precious jewel


And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No I don't, No I don't, No I don't
Want anybody else but you

I don't, No I don't, No I don't, No I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No I don't, No I don't, No I don't
Want anybody else but you

I want to fall, fall so far
I want to fall, fall so hard

I call it magic
And I call it true
Call it magic

Ooh

And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
"Still believe in magic?"
Well yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Of course I do
