You Wouldn't Like Me When I'm Angry 
Thom Yorke

[Intro]
Sliding down the tree
Sliding down the tree

[Verse 1]
I can't come when you call me
I am not who you saw
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry
My dark places
Just when you left
What should not
Just is

[Hook]
You've built this up
You've built this up
You've built this up
You've built this up
You've built this up
You've built this up

[Verse 2]
I don't want to disappoint you
I am not who you want
Growing arms
Growing legs
My loss
Is your gain

[Hook]
You've built this up
You've built this up
You've built this up
You've built this up
You've built this up
You've built this up

[Hook]
You've built this up
You've built this up
You've built this up
You've built this up
You've built this up
You've built this up

[Outro]
