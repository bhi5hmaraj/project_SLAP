We Can't Stop 
Miley Cyrus

[Intro]
It's our party we can do what we want
It's our party we can say what we want
It's our party we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want
We can screw who we want

[Verse 1]
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
Cause we came to have so much fun now
Bet somebody here might get some now
If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "hell no"?
Cause we gonna go all night
Till we see the sunlight, alright

[Pre-Hook]
So la-da-di-da-di we like to party
Dancing with Molly
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
This is our rules
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it we who bout' that life

[Hook]
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody

[Intro]
It's our party we can do what we want
It's our party we can say what we want
It's our party we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want
We can screw who we want

[Verse 2]
To my homegirls here with the big butt
Shaking it like we at a strip club
Remember only God can judge ya
Forget the haters, cause somebody loves ya
And everyone in line in the bathroom
Trying to get a line in the bathroom
We all so turnt up here
Getting turnt up yea yea

[Pre-Hook]
So la-da-di-da-di we like to party
Dancing with Molly
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
This is our rules
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it we who bout' that life

[Hook]
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody


[Intro]
It's our party we can do what we want
It's our party we can say what we want
It's our party we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want
We can screw who we want

[Bridge]
It's our party we can do what we want to!
It's our house we can love who we want to!
It's our song we can sing if we want to!
It's my mouth I can say what I want to
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Eh!

[Hook]
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody
