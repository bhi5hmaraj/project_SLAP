Radio 
Kristinia Debarge

I like it loud
So turn it up
I like it hard
So blow it up

I like it loud
So turn it up
I like it hard
So blow it up

Got my legs around your neck like a turn up
Cook,cook,cook,cook
Get me all around
Give it all
Give it all
Give it all

What time
You better turn around
Got the windows
You better fire out right now

What time
You better turn around
You gonna see I like it loud
You gonna see it I like it loud

Just turn me up like a radio
Turn me up like a radio
Turn me up like a radio
Like a radio
Like a radio

I like it loud
So turn it up
I like it hard
So blow it up

Face on the bottom
Hold on to my [?]
Drop,drop,drop,drop
Hello, yeah baby hello

What time
You better turn around
Got the windows
You better fire out right now

What time
You better turn around
You gonna see I like it loud
You gonna see it I like it loud

Just turn me up like a radio
Turn me up like a radio
Turn me up like a radio
Like a radio
Like a radio

It's so hot in my trunk
Your speakers are on fire

Turn me up like a radio
Like a radio
Like a radio

Just turn me up like a radio
Turn me up like a radio
Turn me up like a radio
Like a radio
Like a radio

It's so hot in my trunk
Your speakers are on fire

Turn me up like a radio
Like a radio
Like a radio
