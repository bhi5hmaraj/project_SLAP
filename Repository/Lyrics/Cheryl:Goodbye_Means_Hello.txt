Goodbye Means Hello 
Cheryl

Cuo cuo cuo cuo cuo
You got me going
Cuo cuo cuo cuo cuo
It's all because of
You you you you you
You got me going
Cuo cuo cuo cuo cuo

Let's take a moment and own it
And not be scared to show it
And love like we never had before
I know you know it, don't hold it
Back it up and start to glow it
And I don't wanna see it no more

In in in and out we go
Out of love and I don't know
How to keep my cool around you
In in in and out we go
Why'd you make it difficult?
Boy, I'm getting fed up with you

As soon as I say goodbye
I'm feeling alone
Ain't no way I can live without you
So by midnight
I'm back on the phone
Ain't no way I can live without you
See the love high
Killing all the lows
Tell me why
We don't keep a steady flow
So my goodbyes really mean hello
Really mean hello
Really, really mean hello

Cuo cuo cuo cuo cuo
You got me going
Cuo cuo cuo cuo cuo
It's all because of
You you you you you
You got me going
Cuo cuo cuo cuo cuo

I never chose you, I chose to
Get on a roller coaster of love
But that's what life had in store
As much as I want to jump off
My heart is saying hell no
Some how you got it beating for more

In in in and out we go
Out of love and I don't know
How to keep my cool around you
In in in and out we go
Why'd you make it difficult?
Boy, I'm getting fed up with you

As soon as I say goodbye
I'm feeling alone
Ain't no way I can live without you
So by midnight
I'm back on the phone
Ain't no way I can live without you
See the love high
Killing all the lows
Tell me why
We don't keep a steady flow
So my goodbyes really mean hello
Really mean hello
Really, really mean hello

I know that we argue, fuss and fight
Who said love was easy, don't know life
That's true... I'm crazy 'bout you
I know that we made love till daylight
Who said love was easy might be right
It's true... I'm crazy about you

Sun in the sky, feeling alright
At the same time we don't want it to change
It's you and I, pleasure and pain
At the same time we don't want it to change

As soon as I say goodbye
I'm feeling alone
Ain't no way I can live without you
So by midnight
I'm back on the phone
Ain't no way I can live without you
See the love high
Killing all the lows
Tell me why
We don't keep a steady flow
So my goodbyes really mean hello
Really mean hello
Really, really mean hello

Cuo cuo cuo cuo cuo
You got me going
(Really mean hello)
Cuo cuo cuo cuo cuo
(Really, really mean hello)
It's all because of
You you you you you
(Really mean hello)
You got me going
(Really, really mean hello)
Cuo cuo cuo cuo cuo
