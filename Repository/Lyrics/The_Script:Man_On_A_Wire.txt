Man On A Wire 
The Script

When I walk that line
I try to keep my senses
Make it to the other side
I know the consequences

And I feel like I'm walking a tightrope
And my heart is in my throat
I'm counting on high hopes
To get me over you
I'll walk with my eyes closed
As long as the wind blows
I'm counting on I'm counting on high hopes
To get me over you
Cause I'm a man on a wire
