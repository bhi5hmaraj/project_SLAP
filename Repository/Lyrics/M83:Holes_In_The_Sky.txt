Holes In The Sky 
M83

Arms to the ground,
Far from the rivers
Grace in our tears,
High on a fever
Somebody heal me from my pain
I'm reaching closer,
My stars dive lower
Filling up lost memories

Holes in the sky
Pierced by the fire
Somebody tell me this is real

Hands to the sky, I am a dreamer
We build the hope,
We are believers,
Somebody free me from my chains
I'm reaching closer,
My star dive lower
Filling up my memories.

Holes in the sky
Pierced by the fire
Somebody pull me from the dark

Arms to the ground,
Far from the rivers
Somebody heal me from my pain
Hands to the sky,
I am a dreamer
Somebody free me from my chains
