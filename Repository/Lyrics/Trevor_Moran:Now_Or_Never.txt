Now Or Never 
Trevor Moran

All these different places
And pretty faces
Always see something new
I don't wanna boy
I'll try to show ya whatever I have to do

I'm caught in the middle
In the middle of a lie
It's not enough
Not enough but a lie
I'm caught in the middle
In the middle of a lie
It's not enough
Nothing enough for an eye

I can't wait forever
This just now or never
Don't want this to be over
It's just now or never

All the people see me
Sit down and hear me
There's nowhere I have to go
What I want to say
I'm not going away
It's something you should know

I'm caught in the middle
In the middle of a lie
It's not enough
Not enough but a lie

I'm caught in the middle
In the middle of a lie
It's not enough
Nothing enough for an eye
I can't wait forever

This just now or never
Don't want this to be over
It's just now or never
Don't want this to be over

It's just now or never
It's just now or never
It's just now or never
It's just now or never
It's just now or never
