This Is How We Do 
Katy Perry

(This is how we do, This is how we do)

Sipping on RosÃ©, Silverlake sun coming up all lazy
(This is how we do)
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy,
Still up, still fresh as a daisy.

Playing ping pong all night long,
Everything's all neon and hazy
(This is how we do)
Chanel this, Chanel that,
Hell yeah, all my girls vintage Chanel baby

It's no big deal, It's no big deal, It's no big deal
This is no big deal

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

Big hoops, and maroon lips,
My clique hoppin' in my Maserati
(This is how we do)
Santa Barbara-chic, at La Super Rica
Grabbing tacos, checking out hotties

Now we talking astrology
Getting our nails did, all Japanese-y
(This is how we do)
Day drinking at the Wildcat
Sucking real bad at Mariah Carey-oke

It's no big deal, It's no big deal, It's no big deal
This is no big deal

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This one goes out to the ladies, at breakfast, in last night's dress
Uh huh, I see you
Yo, this goes out to all you kids
That still have their cars at the club valet and it's... Tuesday
(Straight stunting)
Yo, shout out to all you kids,
Buying bottle service, with your rent money
Respect!

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

This is how we do
This goes out to all you people going bed with a ten and waking up with a two
This is how we do, straight stuntin'
Ha, not me

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin' yeah we do it like that
This is how we do, do do do do, this is how we do

What? Wait. No, no, no, no
Bring the beat back.
That's right

(This is how we do)
