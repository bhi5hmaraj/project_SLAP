Bang Bang 
Tamar Braxton

Bang bang, bang bang
Bang bang, bang bang
Bang bang, bang bang

Tell me, tell me baby
Can I test my limit with you?
âCause I'm feeling kind of wavy
When I see just what my body can do
Can you turn me around, put it down
Can you tear it up?
Gotta know that you can go on till I had enough
Don't mean to under estimate you, I'm just making sure
âCause baby I'm a pro and I don't need no amateur
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I get loose, what you gonna do about it
I'm talking to you
Tell me hey, hey,
If you can't finish boy don't get me started
No baby, don't waste my time

Hey, 'cause honey I gotta know if you're that kind of man
That can catch it
âCause I throw it back like bang bang,
Throw it back like bang bang
Throw it back like bang bang
Throw it back like bang bang
Throw it back like
I want it yeah 'cause this ain't no regular
You ain't never had one like me, no no
It might hit your pride boy, if you ain't ready
I'll be going bang bang
Throw it back like bang bang
Throw it back like bang bang
If my body was a weapon, my sex is gonna take you out

Smoke kush so I got no stress
Stuntin' it ain't no contest
Diamonds all on my Rolex
âCause I go hard like the ninetiacs
Seem them dudes copying our moves
Now you following our steps
Little kids just in the mirror
All insecure just tryina flex
Speaking of flex, shoutout to flex
And everyone else that said dude is next
Tell these lame niggas cut the check
Try the rest now try the best
Gangstas, trippy niggas, all here with me nigga
My weed, so strong, my brain, so gone
Uh, out of space solo
Uh, my chain Polo, uh my vein, so long
Like flossing, straight flossing
Take strands and we cross them
My chains they, they cost them
They hating, we awesome

Hey, 'cause honey I gotta know if you're that kind of man
That can catch it
âCause I throw it back like bang bang
