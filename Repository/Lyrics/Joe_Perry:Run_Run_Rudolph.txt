Run Run Rudolph 
Joe Perry

Run Run Rudolph, Santa's gotta make it to town
Santa's in a hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Then away went Rudolph, reelin' like a merry-go-round

[Verse 1]
Said Santa to a girl child, "What'd please you most to get?"
"A little baby doll that could cry, drink, sleep and wet"
Then away went Rudolph, whizzin' like a Phantom jet

Run Run Rudolph, Santa's gotta make it to town
Santa's in a hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Then away went Rudolph, reelin' like a merry-go-round

[Verse 2]
Said Santa to a boy child, "What have you been longing for?"
"Well all I want for Christmas is a rock'n'roll electric guitar"
Then away went Rudoph, whizzin' like a shooting star

Run Run Rudolph, Santa's gotta make it to town
Santa's in a hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Then away went Rudolph, reelin' like a merry-go-round
Break for double stop guitar solo over verse

Said Santa to a girl child, "What'd please you most to get?"
"A little baby doll that could cry, drink, sleep and wet"
Then away went Rudolph, whizzin' like a Phantom jet

Run Run Rudolph, Santa's gotta make it to town
Santa's in a hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Then away went Rudolph, reelin' like a merry-go-round

Run Run Rudolph, Santa's gotta make it to town
Santa's in a hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Then away went Rudolph, reelin' like a merry-go-round

Solo guitar to fade
