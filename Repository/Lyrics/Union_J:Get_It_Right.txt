Get It Right

(Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey)

We've been holding on
Stronger, now we made it to the shore
The hurricane won't follow us no more
And together we know what we're fighting for
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

[George]
Cause we're here to stay
Living in the moment, it's our day
Know the love we had it still remains
Never going back the way we came
(Hey hey, hey hey)

[All]
Cause we've been waiting for this all our lives
But we'll try to get it right, get it right
Yeah I swear we'll get it right
All alone, you and I
Been the one thing to survive
I see the love in your eyes
As I lay with you tonight
Every time you and I
Oh, I swear we'll get it right
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, we'll be alright
Singing la la la la la and we'll be alright
Singing oh, oh, oh, oh, we'll be alright
Singing la la la la la and we'll be alright

[JJ]
Our victory, is learning how to live and what we'll be
Don't forget we're making history
Promises are built on what we dream
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
