Drop That Kitty 
Ty Dolla Sign

I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days of the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed so never mind
And it's worse but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher, the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a n*gga
But soon for a n*gga it be on motherf*cker
âCause all this bullshit, it made me strong motherf*cker

So I pick the world up and imma drop it on your f*ckin' head, yeah!
Bitch, imma pick the world up and imma drop it on your f*ckin' head
(YEAH) And I could die now rebirth motherf*cker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth
Motherf*cker I'm gone
Motherf*cker I'm gone
So I pick the world up and imma drop it on your f*ckin' head, yeah!
Bitch, imma pick the world up and imma drop it on your f*ckin' head
(YEAH) And I could die now rebirth motherf*cker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth
Motherf*cker I'm gone
Motherf*cker I'm gone
