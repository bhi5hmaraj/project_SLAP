This Is My Wish 
Kevin Ross

This is my wish, my wish for the world.
That peace would find it's way to every boy and girl.
This is the time, the time for harmony.
Let love be the song
That everybody sings.

Fill the air with joyful noise
Ring the bells and raise your voice.
Let there be peace on earth
Let there be peace on earth.
Lift your light and let it shine.
Shine, shine, shine
Let every voice be heard
Let there be peace on earth.

I hear the sweetest sound,
The sound of hope to come.
Together we could bring,
Good will to everyone.
Let it start with you
Let it start with me
Let every nation rise
And sing this melody

Fill the air with joyful noise
Ring the bell and raise your voice.
Let there be peace on earth
Let there (peace on earth) yeah.
Lift your light and let it shine.
Let it shine, shine, shine
Let every voice be heard
Let there be peace on earth.
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh,
Ohhh, ohhh, yeah
Let there be (peace on earth)
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, yeah.

Fill the air with joyful noise
Ring the bell and raise your voice.
Let there be peace on earth
Let there be peace
Lift your light and let it shine.
Let it shine, shine, shine
Let every voice be heard
Let there be peace on earth.
