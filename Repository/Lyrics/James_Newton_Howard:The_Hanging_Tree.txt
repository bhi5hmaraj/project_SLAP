The Hanging Tree 
James Newton Howard

Are you
Are you
Coming to the tree
Where they strung up a man
They say who murdered three
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met
At mid
Night in the Hanging Tree

Are you
Are you
Coming to the tree
Where a dead man called out
For his love to flee
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met
At mid
Night in the Hanging Tree

Are you
Are you
Coming to the tree
Where I told you to run
So we'd both be free
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met
At mid
Night in the Hanging Tree

Are you
Are you
Coming to the tree
Wear a necklace of hope
Side by side with me
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met
At mid
Night in the Hanging Tree

Are you
Are you
Coming to the tree
Where I told you to run
So we'd both be free
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met
At mid
Night in the Hanging Tree

Are you
Are you
Coming to the tree
Where they strung up a man
They say who murdered three
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met
At mid
Night in the Hanging Tree

Are you
Are you
Coming to the tree
Where a dead
Man called
Out for his love to flee
Strange things did happen here
No stranger would it be
If we met
At mid
Night in the Hanging Tree
