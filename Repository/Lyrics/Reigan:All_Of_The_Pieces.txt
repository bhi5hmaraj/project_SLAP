All Of The Pieces 
Reigan

The label reads fragile,
We're in a fragile state,
We're holding it together,
With old string and tape.

We've been pushed around and shaken up,
We've been torn and thrown away.
The label reads fragile, I've never felt so safe.

Oh, you and me, so incomplete.
All they see is damaged goods.

We've got all, all of the pieces,
To fix who we are.
We got it between us,
We're on our own,
We're only fragments,
Broken hearts of sadness
We've got all, all of the pieces,
To fix us between us.

Only half of me working,
Wasn't working out.
You got the parts I'm missing,
I got everything you lost somehow.

You and me, can be complete.
Don't have to feel like damaged goods.

'Cus we've got all, all of the pieces,
To fix who we are.
We got it between us,
And we're on our own,
We're only fragments,
Broken hearts of sadness
We've got all, all of the pieces,
To fix us between us. (Between us.)

Ah, our shattered hearts echo.
Ah, we'll make one from two.

'Cus we've got all, all of the pieces,
To fix who we are.
We got it between us,
On our own
We're only fragments,
Broken Hearts of sadness
All, all of the pieces,
To fix us between us.
