I Don't Want To Be Here Anymore 
Rise Against

On pins and needles we are waiting for the fall
We count the days scrathing lines on the wall
Waiting the wings at someone's back and call
No longer recognize the place that I call home
No longer recognize this face as my own
Somewhere, this fate, I lost control

We backed down
We took no for answers far too long
We felt those walls close around

I don't want to be here anymore

I don't want to be here anymore,
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured.
See, I don't think I can fight this anymore,
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn,
And I don't want to be here... Anymore.

On hand and foot we answered every single call
And wethered every day like passing storms
But when they break we will all be gone

Won't back down
Won't take no for answers anymore
These walls close
We pace back and forth

I don't want to be here anymore,
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured.
See, I don't think I can fight this anymore,
I'm listening with one foot out the door
But something has to die to be reborn,
And I don't want to be here... Anymore.

The point where we break
Gets closer every day
But where do we go?
But where do we go?

I don't want to be here anymore

I don't want to be here anymore,
I know there's nothing left worth staying for
Your paradise is something I've endured.
See, I don't think I can fight this anymore,
I'm listening with one foot out the door
And something has to die to be reborn,
And I don't want to be here... Anymore.

We need a better way, we need to let go
(Anymore)
We need a better way, we need to let go
