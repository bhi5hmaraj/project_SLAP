Midnight Train 
Union J

[Josh]
I would run one million miles to the moon
If I knew that you'd be there too
Will you be there too?

[JJ]
I would cross oceans and fields for your touch
The sound of your voice ain't enough
It's never enough

[Jaymi]
I'm running out the door into the dark
Guided by the beating of your heart
Stay right where you are tonight

[All]
You have never felt so far away
If I don't have you now I'll go insane
Stay right where you are
I'm on a midnight train

[George]
I will crawl, swim through the desert alone
No footprints to lead me back home
Never going back home

[Josh]
Your body is a river, yeah
It's twisting and it's turning
I miss you and I miss the way
You let me watch it burn, yeah

[Josh does the melody with harmonies of Jaymi]
Your body is a river, yeah
It's twisting and it's turning
I miss you, yeah, I miss you
So I'm running running running

[All]
I'm running out the door into the dark
Guided by the beating of your heart
Stay right where you are tonight
You have never felt so far away
If I don't have you now I'll go insane
Stay right where you are
I'm on a midnight train

[Josh]
Midnight train

[Jaymi]
I would cross oceans and fields for your touch
The sound of your voice ain't enough
Nothing is ever enough

[Josh]
I'm running out the door into the dark
Guided by the beating of your heart
Stay right where you are tonight

[All]
You have never felt so far away
If I don't have you now I'll go insane
Stay right where you are
I'm on a midnight train
I'm on a midnight train
I'm on a midnight train

[Josh]
Midnight train
