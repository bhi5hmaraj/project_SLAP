Ugly Heart 
GRL

Maybe I'm just crazy
Maybe I'm just fool
Maybe I don't know how to love
But maybe I do!
Maybe you know more then me
But this much is true
This little heart & brave mind, we say
We're through with you!
And I wonder does it blow your mind,
That I'm leaving you far behind!
I wonder does it stop your heart,
To know you're not my sunshine anymore!

Ok you're pretty, your face is a work of art
Your smile could light up ny city after dark
Ok you're a cover boy beauty stand for the beauty mark,
But it's such a pity, a boy so pretty
With an ugly heart

Maybe you'll get married and you will? Your feet
While I gave on my rides away, I will lose no sleep
Maybe on your honeymoon, you'll think of me
But if you don't, I won't tryna tell you I can guarantee
And I wonder does it blow your mind,
That I'm leaving you far behind!
I wonder does it stop your heart,
To know you're not my sunshine anymore!

Ok you're pretty, your face is a work of art
Your smile could light up ny after dark
Ok you're a cover boy beauty stand for the beauty mark,
But it's such a pity, a boy so pretty
With an ugly heart

Ok you're pretty, your face is a work of art
Your smile could probably light up ny after dark
Ok you're a cover boy beauty stand for the beauty mark,
But it's such a pity, a boy so pretty
With an ugly heart, an ugly heart
