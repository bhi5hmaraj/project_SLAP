Sirens 
Cher Lloyd

I carry the weight of you in my heavy heart
And the wind is so icy, I am numb
I carry the weight of you heading back to start
With the thousand eyes on me
I stumble on

I am tired, I'm growing older
Iâm getting weaker everyday, yeah
I carry the weight of you
I carry the weight of you

Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on us still

Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me where the silver lining stays until
The sirensâ calling

We follow the sun down north and hit the night
And you hold me so tightly, itâs hard to breathe

Oh

And Iâm tired, I'm growing older
Iâm getting weaker everyday, yeah
We follow the sun down low
We follow the sun down low

Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on us still

Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me where the silver lining stays until
The sirensâ calling
The sirensâ calling

Yeah Iâm tired, Iâm growing older
Iâm getting weaker everyday, yeah
I am drowning, and youâre stealing every breath
Take me away and just

Lay down here beside me in the shallow water
Beside me where the sun is shining on us still

Lay down here beside me in the hallowed water
Beside me where the silver lining stays until

The sirensâ calling
The sirensâ calling
