Crack In The Pearl Part 2 
Mark Ronson

Leave em stars in the roads and the rubble
Night has just come over us [?]
?!
Night has just come over us [?]

I was the first one to say that
You were the first one to fall
Like a half coming down from the [?]
She will be over me [?]
Now I get that it's all been a lie
Jumped through my life to take that
[?] I got stone from the night star
Crack in the [?] in the back
