Damn You Seventeen 
Lady Antebellum

I still smell the smoke
I still taste the crowd
I still feel the line of love
The backseat with the windows halfway down
Yeah, I still hear "pour some sugar on me" and the tape deck
With both of us singing along
And I still hear me saying
"Baby, not yet, not yet"

We talk about a memory
Damn, girl, you put a few on me, on me

Life pulled out like a limo onto the highway after the prom
Time ran down like a scoreboard on the last Hail Mary bomb
And my heart's still stuck at a stoplight
With you sittin' there next to me
And the red light won't turn green
Yeah, it won't turn green
Damn you seventeen
Damn you seventeen

I still smell your hair
I still taste the salt
Mixed with the cherry on your lips
Afraid your momma might come home
I still see all of your vintage rock n' roll t-shirts
Hangin' on your closet door
Back when we really didn't know what we were
We were

We talk about our heartache
I still wear it on the replay, the replay

Life pulled out like a limo onto the highway after the prom
Time ran down like a scoreboard on the last Hail Mary bomb
And my heart's still stuck at a stoplight
With you sittin' there next to me
And the red light won't turn green
Yeah, it won't turn green
Damn you seventeen
Damn you seventeen

Well, I wanna call, but I bet your number's changed a couple times
A couple towns ago, but I can't let you go

Life pulled out like a limo onto the highway after the prom
Time ran down like a scoreboard on the last Hail Mary bomb
And my heart's still stuck at a stoplight
With you sittin' there next to me
And the red light won't turn green
No, it won't turn green
Damn you seventeen
Damn you seventeen, oh
Damn you seventeen
(My heart's still stuck at stoplight, with you sittin' there next to me)
Oh
No, no, no, no
(The red light won't turn green)

Yeah, I wanna call ya
Ooh, oh
Damn you seventeen
Oh
