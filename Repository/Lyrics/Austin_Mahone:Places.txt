Austin Mahone

She know it, she know it
Yeah, yeah, she know it
She know it, she know it
Yeah, yeah, she know it
She know it, she know it
Yeah, yeah, she know it
She know it, she know it
Yeah, yeah, she know it

Places slicing confirmation just to see my girl
A million different faces
So many beautiful girls I've seen around the world
You know this situation
We drop it all now, and vacuum as it comes to me
You know that I'll be waiting
Cause I'm dying for your company
Got you screaming out, oh woah, oh woah
Got you screaming out, oh woah, oh woah

Guess she knows that she's all in my head
I can't lie because we both know that it's true
And she knows I'm impressed
By the way what she doesn't what she do
By the way what she doesn't what she do
By the way what she doesn't what she do


Patience girl I know I been gone I been on the road
(I'm coming home)
I know that you been waiting
Stuck in a small town and you're feeling all alone
You're going through these phases
Hold it down girl cause you I'll come for you
I know you've been frustrated
Give it time, I swear we'll make it through

Got you screaming out, oh woah, oh woah
Got you screaming out, oh woah, oh woah

Guess she knows that she's all in my head
I can't lie because we both know that it's true
And she knows I'm impressed
By the way what she doesn't what she do
By the way what she doesn't what she do
By the way what she doesn't what she do

And she know, know, know, know
Because she know, know, know, know
Guess she know know know
Guess she know know know
Guess she know know know
Guess she know know know

Because she know, because... she know
