Thrilla In Manila 
Greyson Chance

[Verse:]
Flying through the night time
And I'm feeling awfully sad
Missing all your punch lines
And they make me feel so glad

[Pre-Chorus]
No joking around, feet off the ground
[?], unless [?] get down
Oh, my time is running out
Yes my face really [?] you out
I'll beat his ass, should I run into a frown
Me and you are never coming down

[Chorus:]
You got nothing wrong with you killa
Thrilla in Manila
The lipstick stains on your boxing glove
You know what I love, you know what I love
What you gonna do when I fight for you?
What you gonna do when I fight for you?
Thrilla in Manila, Thrilla in Manila
What you gonna do when I fight for you?
What you gonna do when I fight for you?
Thrilla in Manila, Thrilla in Manila

[Verse 2:]
State of mind is endless
Yeah I'm fighting for my rights
Baby you my life line
I need you every night

[Pre-Chorus]
And the girls are out
[?]
Oh adrenalin is ecstasy
[?] it's a revelation
I'll beat his ass, and his reputation
I don't even care now it's you and me, oh

You got nothing wrong with you killa
Thrilla in Manila
The lipstick stains on your boxing glove
You know what I love, you know what I love
What you gonna do when I fight for you?
What you gonna do when I fight for you?
Thrilla in Manila, Thrilla in Manila
What you gonna do when I fight for you?
What you gonna do when I fight for you?
Thrilla in Manila, Thrilla in Manila

[Bridge 1]
I'll take a hit for you
I'll take a shot for you
I'll take a fall for you
Anything you want me to

I'll take a hit for you
I'll take a shot for you
I'll take a fall for you
Anything you want me to

[Bridge 2]
I love it when you're sitting close
In all your expensive clothes
Looking through your shades
Can you see all the scars we made?
Heal me in all of your spirit waters
I can even swim to the bottom
If you want I'll drown today
Cuz babyi'll be dying eventually

You got nothing wrong with you killa
Thrilla in Manila
The lipstick stains on your boxing glove
You know what I love, you know what I love
What you gonna do when I fight for you?
What you gonna do when I fight for you?
Thrilla in Manila, Thrilla in Manila
What you gonna do when I fight for you?
What you gonna do when I fight for you?
Thrilla in Manila, Thrilla in Manila

[Outro:]
I love the way you sit me close
In all your expensive clothes
I love the way you sit me close
In all your expensive clothes
You smell au natueral, [?] composed as hell
I may be americano, [?]

Manila
