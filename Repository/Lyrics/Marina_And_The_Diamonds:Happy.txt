Happy 
Marina And The Diamonds

[Verse 1]
Couldn't relax, couldn't sit back
And let the sunlight in my lap
I sang a hymn to bring me peace
And then it came a melody

[Verse 2]
It felt so sweet, it felt so strong
It made me feel like I belonged
And all the sadness inside me
Melted away like I was free

[Chorus 1]
I found what I'd been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
Never thought that I could be, I could be
Happy, happy

[Verse 3]
Don't go out much at all
I've never been the type to call
I realise to be happy
Maybe I need a little company

[Verse 4]
So now you know, you know it all
That I've been des-desperately alone
I havenât found the one for me
But I believe in divinity

[Chorus 1]
I found what I'd been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
Never thought that I could be, I could be
Happy, happy

[Chorus 2]
I believe (I believe) in possibility
I believe (I believe) someoneâs watching over me
And finally (finally) I have found a way to be
Happy, happy

[Bridge]
From the concrete to the coast
I was looking for a holy ghost
Like the land joining the sea
Happiness it followed me

[Chorus 2]
I believe (I believe) in possibility
I believe (I believe) someoneâs watching over me
And finally (finally) I have found a way to be
Happy, happy
