Big Girls Cry 
Sia

[Verse:]
Tough girl in the fast lane
No time for love, no time for hate
No drama, no time for games
Tough girl whose soul aches

[Pre-Hook:]
I'm at home, on my own
Check my phone, nothing, though
Act busy, order in
Pay tv, itâs agony

[Chorus:]
I may cry ruinin' my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I donât look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking

[Verse 2:]
Tough girl, I'm in pain
It's lonely at the top, black outs and airplanes
And I still pour you a glass, of champagne
Tough girl whose soul aches

[Pre-Hook:]
I'm at home, on my own
Check my phone, nothing, though
Act busy, order in
Pay tv, itâs agony

[Chorus - Variation]
I may cry ruining my makeup
Wash away all the things youâve taken
And I donât care if I donât look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking

[Bridge:]
Away I go (13x)
Alone

[Chorus:]
I may cry ruinin' my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I donât look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
