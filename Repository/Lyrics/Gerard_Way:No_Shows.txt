No Shows 
Gerard Way

[Verse:]
Been weeks I been living
And your smiles are giving me all types of treble
Weak knees I been given
And those nights are making me star-struck and metal

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay free, don't go
Cause we don't need no

[Verse 2:]
Try to be living as your vice
And can you be my type?
Cause we need to be given a good life
And can I be your type of metal?

[Chorus:]
Stay free, don't go
Cause we don't need no shows
We don't need no shows
We don't need no shows

[Verse 3:]
Pay for the devil, a plug to a pedal
I'm your type
Weak knees from the level, I'm sick from the treble
I'm your type of metal

[Pre-Chorus]
Weak knees don't go
Cause we don't need no shows

[Bridge:]
She's sweet as battery, man I got nothing
You kiss an enemy's hands, I got nothing
We got an animal band and that's something
It's not love if it's just fucking

We don't need no shows
