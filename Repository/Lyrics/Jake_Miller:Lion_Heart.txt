Lion Heart 
Jake Miller

I would never try to tame you and your lion heart
Promise me you'll never change
I'm wild for the way you are
And when we touch it makes me feel love in a stolen car
So I will never try to tame you
You, you and your lion heart
You and your lion heart
You and your lion heart

They will never understand you and your lion heart
Yeah I'm the only one who can love you the way you are
So tear open set me free
We'll run underneath the stars
I swear that I will never leave
You and your lion heart

Yeah girl you're crazy
And I love it
This others dudes they don't cut it
They can't handle the fact you walk your own path but me
I can't get enough of it
Cause you're wild but me too
So it's good just come through
I can show you the night of your life
Girl we can turn our whole world into a zoo

Yeah, so baby let me hear your roar
Come and bounce on me like never before
You are the queen of the jungle
I can be the king
I'm right here
You ain't gotta worry about a thing
You're Never going hungry
I'll fight for you
Not to frighten you
Cause every night for you

I could be your light when the sky gets dark
I love you and your lion heart
I would never try to tame you and your lion heart
Promise me you'll never change
I'm wild for the way you are
And when we touch it makes me feel love in a stolen car
So I will never try to tame you
You and your lion heart

You and your lion heart

You and your lion heart
I would never try to tame you
