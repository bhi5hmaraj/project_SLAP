The Dying Of The Light 
Noel Gallagher

[Verse 1]
We keep on running but we can't get to the mountain
Behind the mighty [?] years that I have spend
I've been sinking like a flower in a fountain
When all the world I'm gonna need is heaven sent

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've tried my best to get there
But I can't afford the bus fair
And the storm that's rolling over
And it makes me wanna cry

[Chorus]
And I was told these dreams were paved with gold
There'd be no time for getting old when we were young
It's alright, if we're dead, we'll meet tonight
We'll fight the dying of the light, we'll catch the sun

[Verse 2]
Woke up sleeping on a train that was bound for nowhere
Echoes that I could hear were all my own
The world would turn and I've become a stranger
And I'm tired of watching all the flowers turn to stone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've tried my best to get there but I can't afford the bus fair
And the storm that's rolling over and it makes me wanna cry
And the cold that gets my shoulder, when it [?] all in the winter
And it seems to last forever and it makes me wanna, it makes me wanna cry

[Chorus]
