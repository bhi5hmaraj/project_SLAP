The United Rocking Dead 
Lordi

Do you hear the rumble of fear in the distance?
Louder than thunder, extreme absurd
Your shock can not overcome resistance
Drown the elite of the underworld

[Chorus:]
We are here!
And what you see is what you get
Play my fear
We're the united rocking dead

There's no escaping or domination
Bow to our will or you we will break
A lucky future into obedience
Fall to maintain order in our way

[???]

[Chorus:]
We are here!
And what you see is what you get
Play my fear
We're the united rocking dead

[Chorus:]
We are here!
And what you see is what you get
Play my fear
We're the united rocking dead

[Chorus:]
We are here!
And what you see is what you get
Play my fear
We're the united rocking dead
