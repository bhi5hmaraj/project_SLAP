Waiting For This Love 
Austin Mahone

Oh
I've been thinking about all the things that we can do
When it's me and you
And oh
You're body's calling me
I'll fulfill your needs
I can be your fantasy

We started from the bed
Take it to the floor
Tell me what you need
Baby let me know
We don't need no rush
Baby take it slow
'Cause all this is for
You and me alone
Shut off all the phones
Roommate ain't home
Hope it's to ourselves
Imma make it known
Ain't nobody else
You know that

We gon stay the night in
'Cause I've been
Waiting for this love
No I just can't get enough
We're gonna stay the night in
The time is
Right for me and you
Ain't no telling what we do

Got me talking, love you
Got me talking, love you
Now we're talking, love you
I've been waiting for this love
Got me talking, love you
Got me talking, love you
Now we're talking, love you
I've been waiting for this love

All the neighbor's knocking
I won't let them in
And say I'm finished with you
Yeah, yeah
They knocking, they knocking
They knocking, they knocking

We started from the bed
Take it to the floor
Tell me what you need
Baby let me know
We don't need no rush
Baby take it slow
'Cause all this is for
You and me alone
Shut off all the phones
Roommate ain't home
Hope it's to ourselves
Imma make it known
Ain't nobody else
You know that

We gon stay the night in
'Cause I've been
Waiting for this love
No I just can't get enough
We're gonna stay the night in
The time is
Right for me and you
Ain't no telling what we do

Got me talking, love you
Got me talking, love you
Now we're talking, love you
I've been waiting for this love
Got me talking, love you
Got me talking, love you
Now we're talking, love you
I've been waiting for this love

And after all
The time we've spent
You can have my heart time and time and time again
And through these nights
You got me mesmorized
Thinking how'd I get your body right here next to mine
And when the hours past
And the feelings last
I fall in love with the way you talk and they way you laugh
You know I've waited for this love

We gon stay the night in
'Cause I've been
Waiting for this love
No I just can't get enough
We're gonna stay the night in
The time is
Right for me and you
Ain't no telling what we do

Got me talking, love you
Got me talking, love you
Now we're talking, love you
I've been waiting for this love
Got me talking, love you
Got me talking, love you
Now we're talking, love you
I've been waiting for this love
