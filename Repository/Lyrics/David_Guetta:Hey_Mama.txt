Hey Mama 
David Guetta

Yes I be your woman
Yes I be your baby
Yes I be whatever that you tell me when you ready
Yes I be your girl, forever your lady
You ain't never gotta worry, I'm down for you baby

Best believe that when you need that
I'll provide that you will always have it
I be on deck keep it in check
When you need that I'mma let you have it

You play my drum like dum di di dey
I love the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like hey mama mama mama hey mama mama
Begging the drum like dum di di dey
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like hey mama mama mama hey mama mama

Yes I do the cooking
Yes I do the cleaning
Yes I keep the nana real sweet for your eating
Yes you be the (boss) yes I be respecting
Whatever that you tell me cause it's game that you be spitting

Best believe that when you need that
I'll provide that you will always have it
I be on deck keep it in check
When you need that I'mma let you have it

You play my drum like dum di di dey
I love the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like hey mama mama mama hey mama mama
Begging the drum like dum di di dey
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like hey mama mama mama hey mama mama

So baby when you need that give me a word I be good I be bad for my baby

Make sure that he's getting his (shit)
Make sure that his baby take care
Make sure mama? on her knees keep him please bottom down be a lady and a freak

You play my drum like dum di di dey
I love the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like hey mama mama mama hey mama mama
Begging the drum like dum di di dey
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like hey mama mama mama hey mama mama
