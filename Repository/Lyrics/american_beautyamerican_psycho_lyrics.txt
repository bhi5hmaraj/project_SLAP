American Beauty/American Psycho 
Fall Out Boy

[Chorus:]
She's an American beauty
I'm an American psycho
She's an American beauty
I'm an American
I'm an American
American Psycho
(Woah Woah Woah)

I'm an American
I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho

I think I fell in love again
Maybe I just took too much cough medicine
I'm the best worst thing that hasn't happened to you yet
The best worst thing (Woah)
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
And you can kill me, kill me or let God sort âem out
And you can kill me, kill me or (Woah)

[Chorus]

(Woah Woah Woah)

I'm an American
I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho

I wish I dreamt in the shape of your mouth
But it's your thread count I really care about
Stay up 'til the lights go out
Stay up, Stay up
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
And as we're drifting off to sleep
All those dirty thoughts of me
They were never yours to keep, keep (Woah)

Altar boys, altered boys
We're the things that love destroyed
(I'm an American, I'm an American)
You, me, us, them
We're just resurrection men
(I'm an American, I'm an American)
Us, we were only there, to make you live again
(I'm an American, I'm an American)
Us, we were pity sex, nothing more and nothing less
(I'm an American)

[Chorus:]
She's an American beauty
I'm an American psycho
She's an American beauty
I'm an American
I'm an American
American Psycho
(Woah Woah Woah)

I'm an American
I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho
(Woah Woah Woah)

I'm an American
I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho
