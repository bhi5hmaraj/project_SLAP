Teacher 
Nick Jonas

Right when I think I finally got you figured out
You turn around, blow my mind
So frustrated, girl you make me wanna shout
And it's the only the start of the night
And I'm like, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God

What you do me more?
What you do me more?
When you wear that dress, and my heart can't take it anymore
What you do me more?
What you do me more?
When you act like this, it's like your momma never told you how to love

So let me teach you

Take on step forward
Then we take a couple back
But you know I'm gonna keep up the pace
This game we're playing make me wanna break the rules
Can't let you get away from me
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God

What you do me more?
What you do me more?
When you wear that dress, and my heart can't take it anymore
What you do me more?
What you do me more?
When you act like this, it's like your momma never told you how to love

So let me teach you

It's something I can tell
Cause everybody here is gone
Can your body tell?
It's something I can tell
Cause everybody here is gone
Can your body tell?

What you do me more?
What you do me more?
When you wear that dress, and my heart can't take it anymore
What you do me more?
What you do me more?
When you act like this, it's like your momma never told you how to love

So let me teach you
