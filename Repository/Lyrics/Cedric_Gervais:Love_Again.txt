Love Again 
Cedric Gervais

Time moves fast, while we're silently waiting
Holding back, heavy heart feel it breaking
'Cause there is no light in this dark city
No rain to run for cover
No one to blame for what we're guilty of

Maybe all that we need is a heartbreak to love again
Maybe all that we need is an ending to start again
Might take a lonely run, to find out where that goes
Maybe all that we need is a heartbreak to love again

Maybe all that we need is a heartbreak to love again
Maybe all that we need is an ending to start again
Might take a lonely run, to find out where that goes
Maybe all that we need is a heartbreak to love again

Days roll by, waking up to a sunset
The empty sign makes it harder to forget
That there's no light in this dark city
No rain to run for cover
No one to blame for what we're guilty of

Maybe all that we need is a heartbreak to love again
Maybe all that we need is an ending to start again
Might take a lonely run, to find out where that goes
Maybe all that we need is a heartbreak to love again

Maybe all that we need is a heartbreak to love again
Maybe all that we need is an ending to start again
Might take a lonely run, to find out where that goes
Maybe all that we need is a heartbreak to love again
