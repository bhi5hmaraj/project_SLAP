Push 
Sia

Feeling good on a Wednesday
The image of me that you see
Is distorted, twisted, broken, fractured
Isolated miles out to sea

I don't want a separate place
I need to feel safe not thrown away away away away

And I will push (push) to tear down the walls
(Push Push)
Of this box you put me in
(Push Push)
Push ow hot, push ow hot
(Push Push)
To find a label that fits me
I'm feeling good on a Wednesday with the sparkling thoughts

Help me unload the car ya ya ya
And so I push to close the door
Of the stall you've made for me to keep me away
And now we push, push to stand together
Because I am Lorde
Ya Ya Ya
Ya Ya Ya I am Lorde
I am Lorde Ya Ya Ya
Ya Ya Ya I am Lorde
Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya
I am Lorde
Ya Ya Ya
