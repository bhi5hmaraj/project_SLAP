Immortal 
Marina And The Diamonds

[Verse 1]
I wanna be immortal
Like a god in the sky
I want to be a silk flower
Like I'm never gonna die
I wanna live forever
Forever in your heart
And we'll always be together
From the end to the start

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That's what we do it for to reserve a place
It's just another part of the human race
That's what we do if for to reserve a space
In history it's just
Part of the human race, race
(Race, race, race, race) (x4)


[Chorus]
I'm forever chasing after time
But everybody dies, dies
If I could buy forever at a price
I would buy it twice, twice
But if the world ends in fire
And the seas are frozen in time
There'll be just one survivor
The memory that I was yours and you were mine
Everybody dies, dies
Chasing after time, time

[Verse 2]
When you love somebody
They'll always leave too soon
But a memory, a memory
Can make a flower bloom
We wanna be remembered
Don't wanna live in vain
But nothing lasts forever
This world is in a losing game

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna mean something to somebody else
Feel a significance in the real world
It's not enough to live out a lucky life

[Chorus]
I'm forever chasing after time
But everybody dies, dies
If I could buy forever at a price
I would buy it twice, twice
But if the world ends in fire
And the trees are frozen in time
There'll be just one survivor
The memory that I was yours and you were mine
Everybody dies, dies
Chasing after time, time

[Bridge]
No, I don't want to be afraid, afraid to die
Just want to be able to say that i have lived my life
Oh, all these things that humans do
To leave behind a little proof
But the only thing that doesn't die is love

[Chorus]
I'm forever chasing after time
But everybody dies, dies
If I could buy forever at a price
I would buy it twice, twice
But if the world ends in fire
And the seas are frozen in time
There'll be just one survivor
The memories of our life time
Everybody dies
Chasing after time

[Outro]
So keep me alive
So keep me alive
So keep me alive

"Sad to think of the horrors so many good people went through there but they
deserve our attendance to keep their memories alive."
