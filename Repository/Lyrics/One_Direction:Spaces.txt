Spaces 
One Direction

[Verse 1: Niall Horan]
Who's gonna be the first one to start the fight?
Who's gonna be the first one to fall asleep at night?

[Verse 2: Louis Tomlinson]
Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?
Who's gonna be the last one to forget this place?

[Verse 3: Zayn Malik]
We keep taking turns. Ohh.
Will we ever learn?

[Chorus: All]
Ohhh. Spaces between us, keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya'
Even though I try
Spaces between us, hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless and I don't know why
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

[Verse 4: Liam Payne]
Who's gonna be the first one to compromise?
Who's gonna be the first one to set it all on fire?

[Verse 5: Harry Styles & Louis Tomlinson]
Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?
Forgetting every single promise we ever made

[Chorus: All]
Ohhh. Spaces between us, keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya'
Even though I try
Spaces between us, hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless and I don't know why
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

[Bridge: Zayn Malik]
We keep taking turns. Ohh. Will we ever learn?
When will we learn?

[Chorus:]
Ohhh. Spaces between us, keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya'
Even though I try
Spaces between us, hold all our secrets
Leaving us speechless and I don't know why
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye?

[Outro: All]
Who's gonna' be the first to say goodbye?
The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between us
The spaces between us
