God Is Love 
Madonna

If God is love and love is God
Then why he actin' like it not
Everyone's afraid to change
Different doesn't make it strange
Who decides what's right or wrong?
Religion shouldn't separate
The jealous who's supposed to hate
We can't deny the way we remain

Never stop
Never stop
Never stop believing
In what
In what you believe in
Never stop
Never stop
Never stop believing

The truth is like the air you're breathing

Never stop
Never stop
Never stop believing
In what, what you believe in
Never stop
Never stop
Never stop believing
Never stop
Never stop

If God is love and love is God
No magician sitting in the cloud
Never let us a set of rules
Determine what you say or do
It's all agreed to disagree
It's in every holy book
Love your neighbor like you should

Never stop
Never stop believing
In what
In what you believe in
Never stop
Never stop
Never stop believing

The truth is like the air you're breathing

Never stop
Never stop
Never stop believing
In what, what you believe in
Never stop
Never stop
Never stop believing
Never stop
Never stop
Don't you ever stop
Moses had to lead the people
Jesus didn't double your sins
So you could treat all people like shit
Have to save the people from falling
All the prophets say the same words
God is love
And love should come first
Never stop
Never stop believing
In what
In what you believe in
Never stop
Never stop
Never stop believing
The truth is like the air you're breathing
Never stop
Never stop
Never stop believing
In what, what you believe in
Never stop
Never stop
Never stop believing
Never stop
Never stop
Don't you ever stop
