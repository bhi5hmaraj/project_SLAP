Nothing Would Be Better 
Nick Jonas

[Chorus:]
Nothing is forever, nothing would be better
Than the love you're giving me
I just gotta have you, wish I didn't have to
When you gonna set me free?
Like it or not, we were doomed from the start
I know that you'll agree
But nothing is forever, nothing would be better
Better than you and me

(And me, and me, and me)
Than you and me
(And me, and me, and me)
You and me

Take the worst of what you got
It hurts more than sticks and rocks
Know I'll be there, know I'll be there
And I will be your punching bag
Throw it out and don't hold back
I said I'll be there, know I'll be there

Because I used to live in fear, it was my own
But there are harder things to be than not alone
You're the broken part of me that makes me whole
I'm so unsure

[Chorus:]
Nothing is forever, nothing would be better
Than the love you're giving me
I just gotta have you, wish I didn't have to
When you gonna set me free?
Like it or not, we were doomed from the start
And I know that you'll agree
But nothing is forever, nothing would be better
Better than you and me

(And me, and me, and me)
Than you and me
(And me, and me, and me)
You and me

We don't turn around unless we're throwing stones
And we crying like there's cracks are all in our bones
You're the broken part of me that makes me whole
I'm so unsure

[Chorus:]
Nothing is forever, nothing would be better
Than the love you're giving me
I just gotta have you, wish I didn't have to
When you gonna set me free?
Like it or not, we were doomed from the start
And I know that you'll agree
But nothing is forever, nothing would be better
Better than you and me
