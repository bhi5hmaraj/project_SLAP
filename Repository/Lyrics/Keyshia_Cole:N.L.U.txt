Keyshia Cole

Together, baby.
Heavenly Father,
Which You are in Heaven
I pray that You keep this love together.

I prayed about this for days
And something told me
That you ain't changin', no.
And I cried from the love that we made
That's why it hurts me
Cause we ain't growin'
After all the things you put me through.

[Pre-Chorus:]
You done apologize so many times, it's like a broken record
And I'm startin' to think that I hate you
We were almost to the best part, best part

[Chorus:]
See, it's niggas like you that
Make it hard to love, make it hard to trust,
So hard.
A nigga like you make me wanna curse, burn up all your stuff
You've got your charm
A nigga like you,
A nigga like you, a nigga like you, a nigga like you
A nigga like you, a nigga like you, a nigga like you
A nigga like you, a nigga like you.

I stayed away for so many days
And something happened
And I'm so afraid.
That we won't ever be here
So, I wonder if you felt that way
When you did the same thing to me.

[Pre-Chorus:]
You done apologize so many times, it's like a broken record
And I'm startin' to think that I hate you
We were all most to the best part, best part

[Chorus:]
See, it's niggas like you that
Make it hard to love, make it hard to trust,
So hard.
A nigga like you make me wanna curse, burn up all your stuff
You've got your charm
A nigga like you,
A nigga like you, a nigga like you, a nigga like you
A nigga like you, a nigga like you, a nigga like you
A nigga like you, a nigga like you.

Every time playin' out like a ring tone
Stomp way kiss on your cheek bone
I got a lot of stake like a T-Bone
Shorty, why I didn't get you a ring on?
I did a lot of things tho I messed up
It's far though, girl, I ain't careful
Boys of my kind don't worth the effort
I can put a dollar with no effort
Come here!
Look at the dumb A in here,
That's me!
Come forward to real!
I bought my girl some earrings,
Chandeliers in her ears and, yeah
I'm a boss and I don't have a beard
They sayin' I'm weird
I like all my fierce prince here, my house
I'm about staying serious
Troubles in bed, had to wake up
Early in the morning, no make up
There's a dumb to the men on the side bed
Ain't no man a nigga like me.

[Chorus:]
See, it's niggas like you that
Make it hard to love, make it hard to trust,
So hard.
A nigga like you make me wanna curse, burn up all your stuff
You've got your charm
A nigga like you,
A nigga like you, a nigga like you, a nigga like you
A nigga like you, a nigga like you, a nigga like you
A nigga like you, a nigga like you.

A nigga like you.
