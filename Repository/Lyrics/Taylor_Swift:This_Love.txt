This Love 
Taylor Swift

[Verse:]
Clear blue water, high tides came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on
And I will
Skies grew darker, currents put you out again
And you are just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

[Chorus:]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead...oh oh oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me...oh oh oh... oh oh oh... oh oh oh

[Verse 2:]
Tossing, turning, struggle through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning, flickered in my mind for only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone
Been losing grip, sinking ships
You showed up just in time

[Chorus:]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead... oh oh oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me... oh oh oh

[Chorus 2:]
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark... oh oh oh
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

[Bridge:]
Your kiss, my cheek, unwashed, you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When you're young you just run
But you come back to what you need

[Chorus:]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

[Chorus 2:]
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me
