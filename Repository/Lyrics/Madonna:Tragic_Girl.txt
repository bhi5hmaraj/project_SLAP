Tragic Girl 
Madonna

[Verse 1]
I tried to change, but I couldn't help myself
I am to blame, I used to be someone else
No-one got throught, nothing came inside the game
You made me feel, when my heart was set on haze

[Pre-Chorus]
I convinced myself that I was invincible but I
Didn't know that feelings cannot turn
You exposed my deepest wound but I felt so safe
Didn't know that you had never loved me

[Chorus]
Every time you say goodbye it feels like the end of the world
Every time I start to cry I feel like the most tragic girl

[Verse 2]
You were so good at pretending that you care
I was alone even with you standing there
You make me doubt everyone that cared for me
I shove them out so that you'd be all I see

[Pre-Chorus]
I convinced myself that I was invincible but I
Didn't know that feelings cannot turn
You exposed my deepest wound but I felt so safe
Didn't know that you had never loved me

[Chorus]
Every time you say goodbye it feels like the end of the world
Every time I start to cry I feel like the most tragic girl
