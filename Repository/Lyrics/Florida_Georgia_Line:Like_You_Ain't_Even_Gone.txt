Like You Ain't Even Gone 
Florida Georgia Line

I still riding around town
With the windows down and your feet upon my dash
Got your rays on and my hats back and we're feeling cool as cash
The night is on, like you ain't even gone
You go sliding through the static trying to find the song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showing up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned, like you ain't even gone

Sunset, dry light, Friday night
Round back, chill a dollar fifty miller high life
Headband, peace sign, looking fly, shotgun
Bullet going straight through a street sign

You had diamonds in your eyes when you were smiling
Even pretty when you're crying
If I said I wasn't missing you I'd be lying
Cause the truth is, girl the truth is

I still riding around town
With the windows down and your feet upon my dash
Got your rays on and my hats back and we're feeling cool as cash
The night is on (another moonlight ride), like you ain't even gone
You go sliding through the static trying to find the song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showing up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned (it still feels so right)
Like you ain't even gone (like you ain't even gone)

Midnight, man looking for trouble
Slipping them should have been in my ear
Got me sipping down those memory double
Blue eyes, summer smoke, sunburn red
Said you were leaving this town, got to runaway
I watched you run away, and girl you should have chased down

Those diamonds in your eyes when you were smiling
Even pretty when you're crying
If I said I wasn't missing you I'd be lying
Cause the truth is, girl the truth is

I still riding around town
With the windows down and your feet upon my dash
Got your rays on and my hats back and we're feeling cool as cash
The night is on (another moonlight ride), like you ain't even gone
You go sliding through the static trying to find the song you love
Smoke rolling up and you showing up like a dime piece in the dust
You got me stoned (it still feels so right)
Like you ain't even gone (like you ain't even gone)
