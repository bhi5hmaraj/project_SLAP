For Ever With You 
Terrace Martin

Let's spend this day together
Loving each other
Let's be seen together
Loving each other

All we have is love and time
I'll make your play and you'll make mine
All we do is laugh and talk
Together, I just wanna be together forever with you,
Forever with you, forever with you
I just wanna be together forever with you,
Together, forever with you

Your heart, your mind, your body, your soul
There is no place I rather go or be
I'm here for you
Nothing else I want to do, I say nothing else I want to do

All we have is love and time
I'll make your play and you'll make mine
All we do is laugh and talk
Together, I just wanna be together forever with you,
Forever with you, forever with you
I just wanna be together forever with you,
Together, forever with you

I just want to play with you
Baby can I play with you?
Forever with you, forever with you
I just wanna be together forever with you,
Together, forever with you
