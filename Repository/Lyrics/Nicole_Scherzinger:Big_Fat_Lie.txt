Big Fat Lie 
Nicole Scherzinger

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I ain't never had my heart broken,
When I say that I should start chocking
I could say I never liked a father figure
But I only seek up meant to be my father figure
I'm never alone, I'm so famous
The seal I'm scrappin' is to make it painless
I am so pretty, uh
God, you're so good uh
California days they say that never ends,
But why does it seems my make-ups never dry?
And if my life's like a perfect sky, why I feel gray inside?
And if I'm living such a wonderful high, why don't feel alive?
But I'ma keep my tears to me
But the truth between me and you is

[Chorus]
Now I'm living a big fat lie, lie lie lie lie lie
You know I love to lie, lie lie lie lie lie
I'm living a big fat lie, lie lie lie lie lie
You know I love to lie
If you look past my features, just a little deeper
I'm living a big fat lie


(So so so so pretty girl
You're so so pretty girl
So so so so pretty, pretty girl)

[Verse 2]
Edit all my picture, make my legs thinner
Eyes just a little lighter, now make my ass just a little bigger
Now add all to my tongue, big smile, take a bow
Go with it, read the prompter!
California days they say that never ends,
But why does it seems my make-ups never dry?!
And if my life's like a perfect sky, why I feel gray inside?!
And if I'm living such a wonderful high, why don't feel alive?!
But I'ma keep my tears to me
But the truth between me and you is

[Chorus]
Now I'm living a big fat lie, lie lie lie lie lie
You know I love to lie, lie lie lie lie lie
I'm living a big fat lie, lie lie lie lie lie
You know I love to lie
If you look past my features, just a little deeper
I'm living a big fat lie

Only a problem has all the answers
That's the secret
Uh, and I don't want to feel you
But I wish I could tell you
It's our little secret.

You know I love to lie, lie lie lie lie lie
You know I love to lie, lie lie lie lie lie
I'm living a big fat lie, lie lie lie lie lie
You know I love to lie, lie lie lie lie lie
If you look past my features, just a little deeper
I'm living a big fat lie
