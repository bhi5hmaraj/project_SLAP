Keyshia Cole

[Verse:]
Damn, I done fell in love ova night
And I don't know how it happened
The minute I looked into your eyes I knew
What ya do that fo'?

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I don't know how it happened
And I don't care why it happened
Ain't mad that I feel for you (come on)
And I don't know how it happened
And I don't care why it happened
But I ain't mad that I feel for you

[Chorus:]
But what ya do that fo'?
You got me trippin' and wait for your call

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I don't know how it happened
And I don't care why it happened
Ain't mad that I feel for you (come on)
And I don't know how it happened
And I don't care why it happened
But I ain't mad that I feel for you

[Chorus:]
But what ya do that fo'?
You got me trippin' and wait for your call
What ya do that fo'?
Come on, baby, tell me, why ya do it?
Are you really lovin' the way that I'm fallin' fo' ya?
Oh, what ya do that fo'?
