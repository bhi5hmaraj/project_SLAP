Get Me Out 
Falling In Reverse

[Verse 1]
School is in, another year
And I just want to disappear again... Again
I hate the world, I just can't win
And sometimes I just wish it would all end... All end
A 1, 2, 3, 4!
I walk around with headphones in
A hoodie on, I'm trying to blend in
Between the other useless kids
That's how I've always been!

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know one day I'll be
The king of the music scene
Like O.M.G.

[Chorus]
So what do you do when everyone fails you?
Am I just a stupid boy with nothing left to lose?
So sick and tired, no desire to stay in this town
So hopefully my hopes and dreams will get me out

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm the stereotype of a fucked up kid
And there's nothing really nice about the way I live
Got no money in my pocket, but I'm handsome and cocky
Start a band with my posy, leave the scene - I'm like Rocky
I'm a late winner, take yo sister to dinner
And I may kiss her but I won't even miss her
I'm a bad boy, big dreams, headin' to the top
And Imma sing my little heart out till all the music stops

[Chorus]
So what do you do when everyone fails you?
Am I just a stupid boy with nothing left to lose?
So sick and tired, no desire to stay in this town
So hopefully my hopes and dreams will get me out

yeah

(Instrumental)
(Ronnie laughs)
GO
(Instrumental)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know one day I'll be
The king of the music scene
Like O.M.G.

[Chorus]
So what do you do when everyone fails you?
Am I just a stupid boy with nothing left to lose?
So sick and tired, no desire to stay in this town
So hopefully my hopes and dreams will get me out

Just get me out (when every one fails you)
Just get me out (with nothing left to lose)
Just get me out (so sick and tired, no desire to stay in this town)
Just get me out (so hopefully my hopes and dreams will get me out)
Just get me out.
