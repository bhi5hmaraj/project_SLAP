One More Time 
Union J

Tonight, watching the sun go down in your eyes
It's just you and me and memories of good times
Now it's the final night of the summer
Let's do it one more time

Turn it up,
We're up all night
Let's get on it
You can't deny,
When the sun comes up
We'll say goodbye
Let's get on it
One more time

Turn it up girl
Ooh oh oh,
Honey!
One more time
