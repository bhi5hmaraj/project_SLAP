Geronimo 
Sheppard

[Verse:]
Can you feel it?
Now it's coming back we can steal it
If we bridge this gap
I can see you
Through the curtains of the waterfall
When I lost it
Yeah you held my hand
But I tossed it
Didn't understand
You were waiting
As I dove into the waterfall

[Chorus:]
So say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!

Can you feel my love?
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
Say Geronimo!

[Verse 2:]
Well we rushed it
Moving away to fast
That we crushed it
But it's in the past
We can make this leap
Through the curtains of the waterfall

[Chorus:]
So Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!

Can you feel my love?
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away
Bombs away
Bombs away

[Verse 3/Bridge]
Well I'm just a boy
With a broken toy
All lost and coy
At the curtains of the waterfall
So it's here I stand
As a broken man
But I've found my friend
At the curtains of the waterfall

Now I'm falling down
Through the crashing sound
And you've come around
At the curtains of the waterfall

And you rushed to me
And it sets us free
So I fall to my knees
At the curtains of the waterfall

[Chorus:]
So Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!

[Outro:]
Can you feel (Say Geronimo! (4x) my love?
Bombs away! (x3)
(Say Geronimo! (x4)
Can you feel (make this leap (x3) my love? Make this leap
Can you feel my love?
