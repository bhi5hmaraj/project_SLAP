Let It Ride 
Brantley Gilbert

I guess we should've seen this comin'
I can't say it didn't cross my mind
Cause we both said we'd take this slow yeah
And here we are dancin' cross that line
Cause you got your lips an inch away from mine
Just to see how long they take to touch
I guess we both got a thing for playing with fire
Cause this looks like it could get dangerous

Chorus:
Just one kiss, I know I'll loose it
And wont know what I'm doing
I can't call it
Guess I'm caught up in this moment,
Let it ride.
Once your lips touch mine girl, it's over
Yeah I think we both know, we can't stop
Were just rocking with this moment,
Let it ride

We're close enough to hear you whisper
Baby do you really care about me, oh yeah
Asked myself man, should I answer;
How head over heals could a man be;

Chorus:
Just one kiss, I know I'll loose it
And wont know what I'm doing
I can't call it
Guess I'm caught up in this moment,
Let it ride.
Once your lips touch mine girl, it's over
Yeah I think we both know, we can't stop
Were just rocking with this moment,
Let it ride

Oh, Let it ride, I know you're worried about tomorrow
The days and the miles
That are bound to come between us
Baby we both knew this was going to be tough
Lets make the most of every second we can borrow
And pray to God that what we got's enough
Were gonna take it day by day;
Mile by mile,
Bridge by Bridge;
Yeah, Smile by Smile

Chorus:
Just one kiss, I know I'll loose it
And wont know what I'm doing
I can't call it
Guess I'm caught up in this moment,
Let it ride.
Once your lips touch mine girl, it's over
Yeah I think we both know, we can't stop
Were just rocking with this moment,
Let it ride
