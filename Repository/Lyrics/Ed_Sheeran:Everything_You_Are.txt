Everything You Are 
Ed Sheeran

I didnât mean to break your heart
I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know youâve found another one
But wonât you just hold me tonight
I wish I never called you up
Nobody told me
And they donât know, they donât speak anymore
So take a good look at us
Wonât you just hold me tonight
And I would stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not, anything like a voice
Cause you were the only one for me
Yeah, yeah

Cause maybe I donât want to lose a lover and friend in one night
If thatâs right
I shouldnât have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I donât want to be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my true loves, everything you are

I never meant to sleep around
I was just lonely
You did the same, again, and again
I know
So hereâs to the both of us
Hereâs to our story tonight
Oh I would stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not, anything like a voice
Cause you were the only one for me
Yeah

Cause maybe I donât want to lose a lover and friend in one night
If thatâs right
I shouldnât have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I donât want to be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my true loves, everything you are

When I see my future
It is with you
Weâll get there
I want my children to be with you together

Cause maybe I donât want to lose a lover and friend in one night
If thatâs right
I shouldnât have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I donât want to be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my true loves, everything you are
Behind my true loves, everything you are
Behind my true loves, everything you are
