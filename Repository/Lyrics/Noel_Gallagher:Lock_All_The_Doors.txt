Lock All The Doors 
Noel Gallagher

[Verse 1]
So I start to shake, tambourine
(Most) devious girl I've ever seen
Standing lost and lonely on the shore
I tried to cherish her every night
Did some kind of whirl with a candle light
I can't seem to reach her anymore

[Chorus]
Lock All the Doors
Maybe I'll never find out
If I can be sure
Like never before this time [?]
The girl on the floor
Turn all the lights
If I can be sure
Like never before this time [?]
You know it's mine
You know it's mine

[Verse 2]
She never hears me when I speak
I gotta find out where that magic sleeps
I can feel you underneath my skin
And if you take off, [?]
Cuz I don't wanna say I've been [?]
Cuz [?] never looked at me with greed(?)

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
