All Year 
Terrace Martin

Ooh ain't nothing better when the lights are off
And all the colors shine throw the door
Anticipate the day brake
All night I'mma drop, under the pine forest
God been so good on you, I know it
All night,
Walk down the hole, stream as the polly
Leave me to all of the love and candy cake
I look at their frequency over take me every time
Uuh I feel your light flaming long enough
Bring me your smile under the Mazel Tov
Come make a movement, we'll remember every time his Christmas
I want you right here into my arms
Close to my heart
Uuh this Christmas, I want you right here
So wherever you know, you should always know
That's all I want all year
So wherever you go you should always know,
Santa man and children's grand'
When we hala now carrying it
Let me take you alone again
Grab my hand, let's begging
When that cause will bring us here
For the left all the language
It's the kind of joy you need to ear
So feel me up
No I don't need no fancy things no. No
No turns and down or golden rings
It's a very simple need
Just to give all the love you bring
This Christmas I want you right here into my arms
Close to my heart,
Oo this Christmas I want you right here
So wherever you go, you should always know
That's what I want all year
The seasons might change but nothing stays the same
And there's not for us to make
I know you ready for you
I've been waiting for it
To unwrap any on you
I can't wait no more
Let me inside, let me inside
You put my name on it
I know you ready for you
I've been waiting for it
To unwrap any on you
I can't wait no more
This Christmas I want you right here into my arms
Close to my heart
