Cool 
Alesso

[Verse 1]
I saw stars on the pavement
California dreams
Looked up through the bright lights
No stars did I see

You said it's all yours if you take it there
I said I can't do it alone I swear
You said it's all yours
It's all yours and you smiled

[Refrain]
It's only you (who)
Loves me like you do (do)
Tryna keep it cool (cool)
But I can't keep cool about it

Acting like a fool (fool)
Wanna scream it from the roof (roof)
I'm tryna keep it cool (cool)
But I can't keep cool about it

[Verse 2]
And for your love I was blind
Drifting at sea
You were the beacon I followed home
You were the one who rescued me

You said it's all yours if you take it there
I said I can't do it alone I swear
You said it's all yours
It's all yours and you smiled

[Refrain]
It's only you (who)
Loves me like you do (do)
Tryna keep it cool (cool)
But I can't keep cool about it

Acting like a fool (fool)
Wanna scream it from the roof (roof)
I'm tryna keep it cool (cool)
But I can't keep cool about it

[Stick]
You said
(Oooh-wooah)
I don't wanna lose your love
(Oh-woaah)

[Refrain]
It's only you (who)
Loves me like you do (do)
Tryna keep it cool (cool)
But I can't keep cool about it

Acting like a fool (fool)
Wanna scream it from the roof (roof)
I'm tryna keep it cool (cool)
But I can't keep cool about it
