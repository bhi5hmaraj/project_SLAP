Dear One 
Mary Lambert

Where did you come from bright star?
What heaven did you leap from dear love?
How can I spell your name without the sound of autumn underneath my tongue?

Without acknowledging the levers who bent me in half Bless them for bringing me
to you
How can i say your name without also breathing the words, "My God I found you"?

How can I ever speak again with this mouth when it has found where it belongs?
When you touch me, I'm a bed of callillys
I will make a house for you and fill it with evergreens
I will paint sunsets on every wall so you can only see beautiful things

How can I say love without wanting to fold myself into you like a thousand
paper cranes?
Dear one,
I was halved the moment I was born
Either piece of me is inside your mouth
And I was found whole the moment you spoke.
