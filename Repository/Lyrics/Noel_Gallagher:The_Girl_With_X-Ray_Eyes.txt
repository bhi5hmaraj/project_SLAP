The Girl With X-Ray Eyes 
Noel Gallagher

I try to hang on to myself
Don't believe in no one else
and I'm shaking like a leaf
As I fall into the street
But the girl with x-ray eyes
She's gonna see through my disguise

I'm going nowhere down a hill
It's hard to swallow, like a pill
That was twisted on your tongue
by the seed of standing still
There was no one to be seen
No one left to hear my screams

So she took me by the hand
And followed clues left in the the sand
As she swallowed space and time
We gathered, pulled and swam
She shot me to the sun
Like a bullet from a gun
When the deed was done
In the morning she was gone

Turn the page and let it go
Like your mother told you so
Life is stretches on for miles
The truth is on your stereo

The girl with x-ray eyes
She's gonna see through your disguise

So she took me by the hand
And followed clues left in the sand
As she swallowed space and time
We gathered gathered, pulled and swam
She shot me to the sun
Like a bullet from a gun
When the deed was done
In the morning she was gone
