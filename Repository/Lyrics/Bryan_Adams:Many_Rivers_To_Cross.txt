Many Rivers To Cross 
Bryan Adams

[Chorus:]
Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way
Wanderin', I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross and it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years and,
I merely survive because of my pride.

[Verse:]
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be in on your own
My woman left and she didn't say why
Well I guess, I gotta try.
Many rivers to cross but where to begin,
I'm playin' for time
There'll be times when I find myself thinkin'
Of committin' some dreadful crime.

[Chorus:]
I've got many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way
Wanderin' I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross and it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for my years and,
I merely survive because of my pride

[Outro:]
Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wanderin' I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross and it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been riped, washed up for years and,
I merely survive because of my pride
