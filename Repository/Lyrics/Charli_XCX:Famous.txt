Famous 
Charli XCX

[Verse:]
Boy on Friday night, spending hundreds like I'm hypnotized
Go...
Need some neon lights, wanna feel like I'm electrified
So help me out
Get yo boyfriend's car, call to pick me up
Oh, let's take if for a ride
What trouble can we find?

[Pre-Chorus:]
One night I'mma gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feelin' so alright
Just, just let we're famous
Got one night, I'mma gonna come and get it started
Now if only we could stand(?), we act so shameless
(Come on, let's lose control! )

[Chorus:]
One night I'mma gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feelin' so alright
Just, just let we're famous
Got one night, I'mma gonna come and get it started
Now if only we could stand(?), we act so shameless
Just like we're famous
Just like we're famous...

[Verse 2:]
Blown up like balloons, pop a glitter sign into the air
Oh oh...
Sweat drips from the roofs, hangin' our lips in the sky
Of diamonds
Music playing loud, take me to the crowd
Could have some glasses on, don't care if we look dumb

[Pre-Chorus:]
One night I'mma gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feelin' so alright
Just, just let we're famous
Got one night, I'mma gonna come and get it started
Now if only we could stand(?), we act so shameless
(Come on, let's lose control! )

[Chorus:]
One night I'mma gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feelin' so alright
Just, just let we're famous
Got one night, I'mma gonna come and get it started
Now if only we could stand(?), we act so shameless
Just like we're famous
Just like we're famous...
