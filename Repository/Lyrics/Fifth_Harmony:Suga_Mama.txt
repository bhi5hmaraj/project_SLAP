Suga Mama 
Fifth Harmony

[Verse 1]
Boy, you know that I want it
I can tell you want me as your lady
Can't deny that you're sexy
So what's it gon' be
Is you gon' get a job
And make some of that green?
You tryna take me out
But you can't pay for me
I guess I got the cash
I'll take one for the team
Baby, can't you see?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohhhh ohhhh
I won't ask you to go

[Chorus]
But I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, baby
I can't be your suga mama
I said, I said
I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, mmm mmm
I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, baby
I can't be your suga mama
And even though
I love the thought of you
No, I can't be your
Can't be your
Su, su, su, your suga mama
Su, su, su, your suga mama
Su, su, su, your suga mama
Mmmmm yeah

[Verse 2]
Hey
I love what you do to me
Ain't nobody love me like- like you do
I won't call you lazy
But how you pay for food
My daddy said 'no'
You ain't no good for me
Not ballin' in that dough
But I'm payin' for your things
Something's gotta change, boy
Hmm please (boy, please)
Oh, baby, can't you see?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohhhh ohhhh
I won't ask you to go

[Chorus]
But I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, baby
I can't be your suga mama
I said, I said
I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, mmm mmm
I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, baby
I can't be your suga mama
And even though
I love the thought of you
No, I can't be your
Can't be your
Su, su, su, your suga mama
Su, su, su, your suga mama
Su, su, su, your suga mama
Mmmmm yeah

[Bridge]
Ain't got that money, money
Ain't got a damn thang
Wish you could be my honey
You make me sang, sang
Ain't got that money, money
Ain't got a damn thang
What you want me to say oohhh

[Chorus]
But I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, baby
I can't be your suga mama
I said, I said
I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, mmm mmm
I can't be your suga mama
Your suga mama, baby
I can't be your suga mama
And even though
I love the thought of you
No, I can't be your
Can't be your
Su, su, su, your suga mama
Su, su, su, your suga mama
Su, su, su, your suga mama
Mmmmm yeah
