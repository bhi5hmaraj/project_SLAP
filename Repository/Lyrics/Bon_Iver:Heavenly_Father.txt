Heavenly Father 
Bon Iver

Ever since I heard the howling wind
I didn't need to go where a bible went
But then you know your gifts seemed heaven sent
Just lead me to a choler
Dad, that's the thing

I don't know how you house the sin but you're free now
I was never sure how much of you I could let in and I'm free now
Won't you settle down baby here your love has been
Heavenly father it's defiantly lava, why you don't carry other names

Heard about a day where it dropped the Know
To go another day as we learn to close

Cause I'm a known coward in a coward wind but you're free now
You turn around now and you count to 10 to see you go now
Well I know now honey that I can't pretend heavenly father
Is whose brought to his autumn and love is left in end

I just been up here for god damn years
Can you see now?
Filling up hulls with god damn fears I am free now
I know about it darling, I've been standing here
Heavenly father is all that he offers
A safety in the end
