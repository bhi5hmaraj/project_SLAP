Gold 
Imagine Dragons

First comes the blessing of all that you dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have it's appeal
But now you canât tell the false from the real

Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold ooh
Everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
Gold
Gold
Gold
Gold

Statues and empires are all at your hands
Water and wine and the finest of sands
When all that you haveâs turninâ stale and itâs cold
Oh, you no longer feel when your heartâs turned to gold

Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
Gold
Gold
Gold
Gold

Iâm dying to feel again
Oh, anything at all
But, oh, I feel nothing, nothing, nothing,
Not so

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
Gold
Gold
Gold
Gold
