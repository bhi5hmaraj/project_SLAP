Can I Get A Moment 
Jessica Mauboy

Too hot to touch?
I'm burning up
Have you heard the news?
I'm on the move

Hey yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Hold up baby
Won't you let me get a little space?
No disrespect,
I'm not impressed right now
I'm doing me

You do the most
You're way too close
It's hard for me to breathe

Can I get a moment? (Hey can I get a moment?)
Can I get a moment? (Hey can I get a moment?)
Can I get a moment?
Can I get a moment to myself?

Can I get a moment? (Hey!)
Can I get a moment? (Hey!)
Can I get a moment? (Hey, yeah!)
Can I get a moment?

Boy what's the rush?
You're doing way too much
Don't wanna be rude
But I'm on the move

Hey yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Hold up baby
Won't you let me get a little space?
No disrespect,
I'm not impressed right now
I'm doing me

You do the most
You're way to close
It's hard for me to breathe

Can I get a moment?
Can I get a moment?
