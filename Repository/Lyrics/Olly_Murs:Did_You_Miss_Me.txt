Did You Miss Me 
Olly Murs

What you've been doing
Since I was away?
Have you felt good?
Have you felt bad?
Did you behave?

It's alright
I hear the night and it's all mine

I know you heard some rumors
And wonder if they're true
But just be patient
I'mma show you something new
Yeah that's right

It's alright
I hear the night and it's all mine

I could tell that you miss me
Your eyes give you away
I know you can't resist me
So tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me

Tell me girl that you missed it
I need to know that you care
You know I'm not interfering
So show me, show me, show me
That you miss me

Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?

Sorry I let you
But I'll make it worth the way
Yeah I remember you
I want another taste

It's alright
I hear the night and it's all mine

I could tell that you miss me
Your eyes give you away
I know you can't resist me
So tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me

Tell me girl that you missed it
I need to know that you care
You know I'm not interfering
So show me, show me, show me
That you miss me

Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?

Cause your eyes give it away
We got an understanding
Don't need worse to explain
Just show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me

Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?

Tell me you miss me baby
Show me you really care
You really care

I could tell that you miss me
Your eyes give you away
I know you can't resist me
So tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me

Tell me girl that you missed it
I need to know that you care
You know I'm not interfering
So show me, show me, show me

Did you miss me?
