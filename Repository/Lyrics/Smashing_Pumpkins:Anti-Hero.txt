Anti-Hero 
Smashing Pumpkins

[Verse 1]
Never been kissed by a girl like you
All I wanna, I wanna do
Love me baby, love me true, ooh
Everything I want, I had to have
And with madness, it's love that's sad
Trust little baby, oh can't you see?
Ooh, it's me

[Pre-Chorus]
Ode to the alien weekend
Wednesday's ring starts to turn slow
You said show them one weakness
Then fill that happy heart

[Chorus]
With a girl like you
All I wanna, I wanna do
Love me baby, oh can't you please?
Ooh, with a girl like you
Thrown with a girl like you
Ooh, with a girl like you

[Verse 2]
Times that preach how it's been
As the straw lives on without
You're so alone, they'll let you in
Ooh, if they let you in

[Pre-Chorus]
Ode to the alien weekend
Stoned where it starts to burn slow
You said show them one weakness
Then give my hand a hold

[Chorus]
With a girl like you
All I wanna, I wanna do
To love me baby, oh can't you please?
Ooh, with a girl like you
Thrown with a girl like you
Ooh, with a girl like you
Thrown with a girl like you

[Bridge]
You can say, I will listen
You can swear, don't mind
You can blot out tradition
Till I'm bored
With a girl like you
With a girl like you, ooh
With a girl like you, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
I'm so alive with a girl like you
I'm so alive with a girl like you
Trust little baby, can't you please?
Thrown a girl like you
