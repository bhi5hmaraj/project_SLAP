Pills N Potions 
Nicki Minaj

[Pre-Hook:]
Pills n potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
Weâre overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

[Hook:] x2
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

[Verse:]
Ayo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doinâ wasnât tasteful
Even though you out here lookinâ so ungrateful
I'mma keep it movinâ be classy and graceful
I told 'em itâs no friends in the game, you ainât learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, donât burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible
That they love you, when really they no different from all your rivals
But I still donât wish death on âem, I just reflect on 'em

[Pre-Hook:]
Pills n potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
Weâre overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

[Hook:] x2
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

[Verse 2:]
Yo, people will love you and support you when itâs beneficial
I'mma forgive, I won't forget, but I'mma dead the issue
Soon as you out a niggaâs life is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good now itâs kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in a Benzy, I see the envy when Iâm causin' a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em, cop cribs in the hills on âem

[Pre-Hook:]
Pills n potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
Weâre overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

[Hook:] x2
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

[Bridge:]
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
In due time weâll be fine
In due time

[Hook:] x2
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
