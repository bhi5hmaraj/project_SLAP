Apocalyptic 
Halestorm

I wear my nine inch heels when we go to bed
I paint the color of my lips blood red
I get so out of mind like never before
So you press play and I'll hit record

'cause when it's pushing up
physical, always slamming doors
You're a bitch, throwing fits
always waging wars
Me and you, sad but true
are not 'us' anymore
But there's still one thing we're good for

I'll give you one last night
So make it twisted
Give you one last shot, go on and hit it
Give you one last time to make me miss it
Baby love me apocalyptic
Come on!

Give me your red imprint right across my ass
I'm leavin' scratches up and down your back
Throw me against the wall, bite me over neck
Like end of the world, break-up sex

'cause when it's pushing up
physical, always slamming doors
You're a bitch, throwing fits
always waging wars
Me and you, sad but true
are not 'us' anymore
But there's still one thing we're good for

I'll give you one last night
So make it twisted
Give you one last shot, go on and hit it
Give you one last time to make me miss it
Baby love me apocalyptic

'cause no one does it better
No one knows me better
'cause nothing lasts forever
Nothin' one lasts forever
It's now or never

(x2)
I'll give you one last night
So make it twisted
Give you one last shot, go on and hit it
Give you one last time to make me miss it
Baby love me apocalyptic
Baby love me apocalyptic
