Yesterday 
Karmin

I'm all out, I'm all out, I'm all out
I'm all out, I'm all out, I'm all out
I'm all out, I'm all out, I'm all out
I'm all out, I'm all out

[Verse 1]
Oh how I missed your eyes
Your half crooked smile
And the magic that you keep in your hands
But goodness, here we go again
Reality knows that I only wanna leave it behind

[Pre-Chorus]
You say everytime, it's the final crime
But we needed the spark cause it's all that we got
See the world is tough on forbidden love
And I don't wanna go in alone

[Chorus:]
Oh, why you got to leave here tomorrow?
Don't you love me like yesterday?
Take my hand and leave all your sorrow
Everything can wait

Oh, why you got to leave here tomorrow?
Don't you love me like yesterday?
Take my hand and leave all your sorrow
Don't throw this away

[Verse 2:]
You said you're over this, the fights and the calls
And I thought that you and I had it planned
You told me you were done with her
But she's got the rock
Which is making this too complicated

[Pre-Chorus]
You say everytime, it's the final crime
But we needed the spark cause it's all that we got
See the world is tough on forbidden love
And I don't wanna go in alone

[Chorus:]
Oh, why you got to leave here tomorrow?
Don't you love me like yesterday?
Take my hand and leave all your sorrow
Everything can wait

[Verse 3: Amy Heidemann]
Straight out, movie scene
No one with the camera, see
Doesn't matter what you say, matter what you do
Livin' on security screens
Late night, dancing queen
Hotel, slot machines
Deal out for me, Dominique
I don't know how long I'll be on a streak

[Chorus: x2]
Oh, why you got to leave here tomorrow?
Don't you love me like yesterday?
Take my hand and leave all your sorrow
Don't throw this away

I'm all out, I'm all out, I'm all out
I'm all out, I'm all out, I'm all out
I'm all out, I'm all out, I'm all out
I'm all out

Ay, Â¿por quÃ© te vas a maÃ±ana?
Â¿No me amas como ayer?
Toma mi mano y dejar sus penas
Todo esperar
