Drum + Fife 
Smashing Pumpkins

[Verse:]
Away, away foul dreams
You're gonna listen now to me
No rules, or in-betweens
You're gonna listen now to me
Waste all your time on another kind of boy (whoa)
I faint up on the line, [?] are out of count

[Pre-Chorus:]
Come on along on an eastern show
Come on along, oh my
Come on along on a winter's morn
Come on along, oh my (my)

[Chorus:]
Inside the drum and fife is steel
Racing scene to scene
To break this beast in me
Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day

[Verse 2:]
Your mind affection drew
You're gonna listen now to me
What's done, what's left as [?]
You're gonna listen now to me

[Pre-Chorus:]
Come on along on an eastern show
Come on along, oh my
Come on along on a winter's morn
Come on along, oh my (my)

[Chorus:]
Inside, the drum and fife is steel
Racing scene to scene
To break this beast in me
To [?]
Cause I will bang this drum to my dying
Cause I will bang this drum to my dying
Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day
Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day

[Bridge:]
Don't you ever be afraid
Don't you ever be afraid
Don't you ever be afraid
No more, no more, no more

[Refrain]
Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day
(Don't you ever be afraid)
Cause I will bang this drum to my dying
Cause I will bang this drum to my dying
Cause I will bang this drum to my dying day
Cause I will bang this drum
