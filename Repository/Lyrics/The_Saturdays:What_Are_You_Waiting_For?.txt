What Are You Waiting For? 
The Saturdays

Tonight we'll run a massive attack
Yeah baby I'm a party freak
And there's no going back
But can you handle that?
Watch me work it out on the floor
Yeah I'm addicted to the beat
Boy what you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Cause the party ain't over till we party throughâ¦
Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon
And baby when you think that you've had enough
We'll take things to whole other love
I want to lose controlmaker
Lose controlmaker
Lose control
I want to lose controlmaker
Lose controlmaker
Lose control
Lose control

Tonight we're pushing it to the max
I'll take away your sanity and you won't get it back
But can you handle that?
Get your body out on the floor
Cause if you're partying with me
Then you gotta keep on
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Cause the party ain't over till we party throughâ¦
Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon
And baby when you think that you've had enough
We'll take things to whole other love

Tonight we're gonna party party party
Wanna see everybody move your body body body
Cause it's the only way that we party party party
Yeah everybody grab somebody, let's get naughty naughty

What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Tell me what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

Cause the party ain't over till we party throughâ¦
Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon
And baby when you think that you've had enough
We'll take things to whole other love
