Guillotine IV 
Falling In Reverse

My heart is on fire again
From the depths of hell it swallows my aim
(something) rolling my aim
Let the rolling begin
Rolling begin

There I go
Seeking for you
Seeking for you
All I know is fighting your way
Fighting your way from the (something)
(something 2 lines)

So long, farewell to the best of me
It's so far away
Cause I'm my own worst enemy
And it's so hard to say
There's no way out
You are on the way to it
Say good bye to the rest of me
The rest of me

(couple of lines later)
My heart is on fire again
From the depths of hell it swallows my aim
(something) is rolling my aim
Let the rolling being
Rolling begin
(couple of lines)

So long, farewell to the best of me
It's so far away
Cause I'm my own worst enemy
And it's so hard to say
There's no way out
You are on the way to it
Say good bye to the rest of me
The rest of me

(Instrumental)
(heavy inhale) MOVE
(Instrumental)

So long, farewell to the best of me
It's so far away
Cause I'm my own worst enemy
And it's so hard to say
There's no way out
You are on the way to it
Say good bye to the rest of me

So long, farewell to the best of me
It's so far away
Cause I'm my own worst enemy
And it's so hard to say
There's no way out
You are on the way to it
Say good bye to the rest of me
