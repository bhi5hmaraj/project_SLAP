Oh wo-oh oh wo-oh oh oh
Oh wo-oh oh wo-oh oh oh

Play the lotto, and you might win it
It's like 20years to life, and you bust out of prison
Something's in the air, something's in the air
It's like that feeling when you're just about to kill it
Take your last shot, you know you're gon' hit it
Something's in the air, something's in the air!
Oh wo-oh!

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling, and I feel it grabbing me
Feel it in my bones like,
Oh wo-oh oh wo-oh oh oh
Oh wo-oh oh wo-oh oh oh
Something big I feel it happening
Oh wo-oh oh wo-oh oh oh
Oh wo-oh oh wo-oh oh oh
Something big!

It's like that feeling when you're 'bout to win the medal,
And you worked so hard, and you knew you wouldn't settle
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air
It's like when they hear you when you thought they weren't listening
And now it's like the anthem that the whole world's singing
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air!
Oh wo-oh!

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling, and I feel it grabbing me
Feel it in my bones like,
Oh wo-oh oh wo-oh oh oh
Oh wo-oh oh wo-oh oh oh
Something big I feel it happening
Oh wo-oh oh wo-oh oh oh
Oh wo-oh oh wo-oh oh oh
Something big!

Wo-oooh oh, yeah, yeah
If we stump our feet, the ground will shake
If we clap our hands the walls will break
Yell so loud won't forget our names
'Cause SOMETHING BIG is happening
Tick this spark and start a fire
Raise this up, we're feeling high
They can't tell us anything
SOMETHING BIG is happening!!

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Push and fall, and it's grabbing me
Feel it in my bones like,
Oh wo-oh oh wo-oh oh oh
Oh wo-oh oh wo-oh oh oh
Something big is happening!
Oh wo-oh oh wo-oh oh oh
Oh wo-oh oh wo-oh oh oh
Something big I feel it happening! Oh!
