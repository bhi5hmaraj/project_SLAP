Grindin 
Lil Wayne

[Intro:]
Grindin', grindin'
Grindin', grindin'
Grindin', grindin'
Grindin', grindin'

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm grindin', I'm grindin', I'm grindin' I promise
I fuck her until I get tired, retired and then I come out retirement
My girl like it rough she said âfind me a diamondâ about to be grindin'
Lord we be on every kind of narcotic, that make us believe when we lyin', we
honest
I love you (we honest, I love you)
Pick, Michael Jackson to Jordan to Tyson to Myers
Too much dirty money when the colors are washing the whites in the dryer my
nigga
It ain't rocket science just rockets I sleep in pussy not pajamas, grindin'
I got this shit down to a science, I turn in my project A minus
Whew, I ain't crazy, I'm krazy and all of my niggas chaotic
Dressed in all black like they gothic, music too loud to hear sirens
We pop, pop, pop where you stay, knock, knock, knock, anyone home?
Pop, pop, pop, pop then we outtie, I need a bitch like Naomi
To take off her clothes like Leilani for niggas that's grindin'

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Nigga I'm grindin' for all my shit
I'm grindin' for all my shit
Yeah, I'm grindin' for all my shit
I'm grindin' for all my shit
Put time into all this shit
(Perfect timing with all my shit)
I'm grindin' for all my shit
I'm grindin' for all my shit
(I think I got it bitch)
I'm grindin' for all my shit
I'm grindin' for all my shit

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
The feds be spying on all of us nigga
These hoes be lying to all of us nigga
I got news for the monogamous niggas
Yo bitch fucking anonymous niggas
I done seen it all my nigga
Cause these hoes seeing all of my niggas
Cause what's the hottest shit on these corners
That's me and all my niggas
Grind for all this shit, I ain't ever fall for that bitch
Cause picking up the feather from a lovebird is like a medicine ball to that
bitch
We will bring Gucci bag in this bitch and you know its stacks in that bitch
These niggas walk around with they chests out like Janet Jackson and shit
I'm sweatin' grindin' this bitch, I need a shrine in this bitch
Fuck double O seven, I work twenty-four seven, ain't got time to bond with no
bitch
Heard Jay-Z got a new Cognac, where to find that shit
The weed sticky, grind that shit, where I got it from? Nevermind that shit

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Drake]
I got a new vision for all my shit, I don't know what to call that shit
I know, I'm selling all of my cars, I'm selling all of my watches, I'm selling
diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don't need that shit, I'm a different breed with this shit
I'm tryna turn M's to B's in this shit and I ain't ever pay to be with no bitch
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed, fifty mill in one room
You could ask anyone out here, who running the game, and they'll tell you the
truth
Man, oh look, they fuck with me now, I think they're hearin' me now
Someone said ânigga they takin' you seriously now"
I'm like "I think they might just be scared of me now"
But it's all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day
Goin' to la where I'm tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain't ever have to play it safe
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I'm runnin' out of space
Mothafucka that's grindin'

[Hook:]

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Grindin', grindin'
Perfect timing
Grindin', grindin'
Grindin', grindin'
I would rather step it up and put it in the safe then peek inside the safe and
say I'm running out of space, believe that
School find another oo-wop
Tell them niggas cool down
Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out
Kidnap a nigga beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out
Top floor, window he get threw out
Duke out
Pussy bitches, douche out
Flying out the crew out
They flew out invite them to my new house, my new house
I'm fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house
Grindin'
I'm fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house
Grindin'
I'm fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house
I'm grindin'
