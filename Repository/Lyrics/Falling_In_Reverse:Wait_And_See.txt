Wait And See 
Falling In Reverse

Call more cars
It's an emergency, listen
Ladies and gentleman we are at the end of existence
Television is fiction
Is telling lies to our vision
It' s like a prison that we're living in
We are in the system

We live in a box
And keep our family tradition
We keep our guns high and we start ignition
We teach our children to kill
Instead of teaching them wisdom
And politicians waging wars and blaming our religions

We're dying
We're losing it
But it's hard to believe
You are not me

So you wait and see
When the world stops spinning
And we all pretending
To be okay
But it's hard to be when you try each day

Open up your eyes
See our vision
So wait and see
When the world stops spinning
I will stop pretending

Call all the people
We are in a state of confusion
Because we hate all we love
And it's a like a drug we're abusing
And we pull up solutions
And we're all equal as humans
Truly you don't understand
What's connecting the music

And all this hatred I'm seeing
And it's all an illusion
People using social media to hurt us
They're stupid
And all these pictures need to cut theirselves on the wrist

We're dying
We're losing it
But it's hard to believe
You are not me

So you wait and see
When the world stops spinning
And we all pretending
To be okay
But it's hard to be when you try each day

Open up your eyes
See our vision
So wait and see
When the world stops spinning
I will stop pretending
To be

What are you trying to say?
Breathe by breathe we're both the same

So you wait and see
When the world stops spinning
And we all pretending
To be okay
But it's hard to be when you try each day

So you wait and see
When the world stops spinning
And we all pretending
To be okay
But it's hard to be when you try each day

Open up your eyes
See our vision
So wait and see
When the world stops spinning
I will stop pretending
When the world stops spinning
I will stop pretending
When the world stops spinning
I will stop pretending

To be okay
But it's hard to be
When you find out it's fake
