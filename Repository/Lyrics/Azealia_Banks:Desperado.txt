Desperado 
Azealia Banks

[Intro:]
Yeah, you know what it is, it's Hot 97
My name is Peter Rosenberg, and, uh
We're gonna get to some new music right now
This is a record called "Desperado"
Okay, by my girl, Azealia Banks
And, I've been waiting for Zee Banks
Waiting for Zee Banks
Waiting for Zee Banks

[Verse:]
(Desperado)
Ups and ups, seductive pup
Flux to the dip back up and strut
Ups like a whip with suck like a wind that
Fuck can I get that rump and uh
Mutts in tux, deluxe and such
I be in the mirror looking lux and plush
Looks and such, seductive strut
I be aquafizzy all that passion punch
All the fashion's munch but the fabric's lush
You don't get the access, none
Sun em on my axis, son
Hit em with the hazard, hun
Pin em on this satin rump
Em with the cat-red blush
Plus I got the cash in the base every spasm, son
Dinner with the princess one
Come get your lips in bum

Print is expensive fun

[Hook 1:]
That's how I do my thing
Desperado
Hey, yo
That's how I do my thing
Desperado

[Verse 2:]
I be pretty prissy plenty plush and stuff
You be picky pissy penny crush and crunch
Crust and dust, slumped and jumped
Goose is a cut so others not trump
Giddy up, this buck, titty tuck, no such
I be freaky fizzy in the front and up
You be very sissy lady lump bitch rump
Betty Bump this bum, brrr-a bum-bum-bun

[Hook 2:]
That's how I do my thing
Desperado
Hey, yo
That's how I do my thing
Desperado
Hey, yo
That's how I do my thing
Desperado
Hey, yo
That's how I do my thing
Desperado
Hey, yo
Desperado
Hey, yo
Desperado

[Bridge:]
We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed
Please, check the number, and dial again
And dial again
And dial again
And dial again

[Hook 3:]
Desperado
Desperado
Hey, yo
That's how I do my thing
Desperado
Hey, yo
That's how I do my thing
Desperado
Hey, yo

[Verse 3:]
Hit em with that acid tongue
Venom in that Python Pump
Betty hunt this honey
Eat a huntress
Get amongst this one
If the freaky function fun
I could be the perfect one
Splurging on the purchase, yum
Merging on the purpose one
When the verse is fun, I'ma hearse this
Can't-can't rehearse this, none

[Outro:]

Desperado
