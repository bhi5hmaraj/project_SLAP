We Gotta Pray 
Alicia Keys

(You know)
We gotta pray
We gotta pray
We gotta pray, pray for the world tonight
We gotta save, somebody save somebody tonight
Fire in the air, what the hell goin' on?
Sirens everywhere, singin' that street song
Violence everywhere, barely holdin' on
What the hell goin' on?
Do you know who you are?
Do you know who we are?

We, we're extraordinary people
Living an ordinary life
Growing stronger to every question
We're gonna make it or dying, 'till we gotta pray

Pray for the love tonight
Another day, pray for another try
Smoke is in the sky, what the hell goin' on?
Bullets gonna fly, fly right from the gun
Trying not to cry, barely holdin' on
What the hell goin' on?
Do you know who you are?
Do you know who we are?

We, we're extraordinary people
Living an ordinary life
Growing stronger to every question
We're gonna make it or dying, 'till we gotta pray

We gotta pray
We gotta pray
We gotta pray,
We gotta pray!
