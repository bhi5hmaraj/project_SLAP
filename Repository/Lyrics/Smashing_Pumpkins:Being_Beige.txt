Being Beige 
Smashing Pumpkins

[Verse:]
I don't love you
For what it's worth
So if you're leaving
Can you hurt?
Cherry blossom
This is goodbye
Come here lately
And you'll fly
When they say
What it's worth
The world tells you're [?]
And you know
Where to hurt

[Chorus:]
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
Have you heard?

[Bridge 1]
Lover let me please
Follow down your [?]
Lover let me please
Be the one
No more prayers to make
Flowers made to beg
When you swore to wait
Your [?]

[Chorus:]
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
Have you heard?

[Verse 2:]
Yes I loved you
As a matter of fact
Your furs are wrapped up
And that's that

[Bridge 2:]
Lover let me please
Fall onto your knees
You once made me smile
Then you strayed

[Chorus:]
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
Have you heard?

[Chorus:]
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
The world's on fire so
Have you heard?

[Bridge 3:]
Lover help me breathe
To make for your release
(To make for your release)
For I no longer am
By your side
What's to hide?

[Outro:]
The world's on fire
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Monday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Tuesday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Wednesday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Thursday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Friday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Saturday
The world's on fire
Until I'm ready on Sunday
