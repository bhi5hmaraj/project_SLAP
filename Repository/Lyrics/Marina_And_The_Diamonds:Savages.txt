Savages 
Marina And The Diamonds

[Verse 1]
Murder lives forever
And so does war
It's survival of the fittest
Rich against the poor
At the end of the day
It's a human trait
Sewn deep down inside of our DNA

[Verse 2]
One man can build a bomb
Another run a race
To save somebody's life and have it blow up in his face
I'm not the only one who finds it hard to understand
I'm not afraid of God
I am afraid of man

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it running in our blood
Is it running in our veins
Is it running in our genes
Is it in our DNA
Humans aren't gonna behave as we think we always should
Yeah, we can bad as we can be good

[Chorus 1]
Underneath it all we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
How could we expect anything at all?
We're just animals still learning how to crawl

[Verse 3]
We live, we die
We steal, we kill, we lie
Just like animals
But with far less grace
We laugh, we cry
Like babies in the night
Forever running wild
In the human race

[Verse 4]
Another day, another tale of rape
Another ticking bomb to bury deep and detonate
I'm not the only one who finds it hard to understand
I'm not afraid of God
I am afraid of man

[Pre-Chorus]
You can see it on the news
You can watch it on tv
You can read it on your phone
You can say it's troubling
Humans aren't gonna behave as we think we always should
Yeah, we can be bad as we can good

[Chorus 2]
Underneath it all we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
How could we expect anything at all?
We're just animals still learning how to crawl
Underneath it all we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties & marriages
Truth is in us all, cradle to the grave
We're just animals still learning to behave

[Bridge]
All the hate coming out from a generation
Who got everything and nothing guided by temptation
Were we born to abuse, shoot a gun and run
Or has something deep inside of us come undone?
Is it a human trait or is it learned behavior
Are you killing for yourself or killing for your Savior?

[Chorus 2]
