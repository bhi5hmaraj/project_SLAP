New York Sunshine 
William Bolton

Oh, baby you're my sunshine
Darling you're my summer breeze
Oh, baby you are so fine, you're so fine
I wanna know what's going on your mind

Seems like I'm always busy
It's summer time chilling up in new york city
I think I'm going crazy
I'm finishing this album
Getting better at this music on the daily oh, daily oh
And I shouts out to ryan
I'm not a mozart yet dog, but I'm trying
I'm up all night and all day and I ain't even lying
It's no days off, 'cause hard work it pays off

So I met this girl from brooklyn
She come to hell's kitchen just to see what's cooking
I live on 45th so she come up to the crib
And then she roll a couple spliffs
Now we getting really, really smoked
She always hold me down,
Calming me every time that I be stressing out
Pick my feet up off the ground
To a smile from a frown
All good no doubt
Man I love when she's around
So I tell her

(X2)
Oh, baby you're my sunshine
Darling you're my summer breeze
Oh, baby you are so fine, you're so fine
I wanna know what's going on your mind

I swear the classroom don't teach knowledge
My parents'd probably kill me when I dropped up out of college
But I'm glad they never doubted
I'm hungry for success
Wanna give them something to be proud of
I made it through the storm, I got it real sick
Last year in the dorms
But now I'm feeling better
It's partially my ab through but probably the weather
Summer breeze!
I must admit, I'm pretty whacky
I'm really sick of being depressed and not happy
I only make this music so that I can be happy
Day-dream all day and all night, it's alright
My girl she hold me down,
Calming me every time that I be stressing out
Pick my feet up off the ground
To a smile from a frown
All good no doubt
Man I love when she's around
So I tell her

(X2)
Oh, baby you're my sunshine
Darling you're my summer breeze
Oh, baby you are so fine, you're so fine
I wanna know what's going on your mind
