Party Ain't A Party 
Keyshia Cole

There's been some years living this life
I've given you everything
And I tried
But you never love me for who I am
Do you even really love me baby?

It seems like it's just a dream
I thought we were meant to be
What once was called love
Ended black and white
And I don't really know you baby

But I won't stress the fam
You know that we're not like that
But you can't go
Cause I'm leaving this time

And I know you really know it baby
If you can't tell
If you can't see
Baby I'm the only one you need
Maybe you should know
Cause I'm about to leave
Cause this party ain't a party
It ain't droppin' no more

If you can't tell
If you can't see
Baby I'm the only one you need
Maybe you should know
Cause I'm about to leave
Cause this party ain't a party
It ain't droppin' no more

When I look into your eyes
I can see the hurt above the line
But girl I need you
I need you to understand
I love you baby

I won't pretend I don't care about you
My heart it shows
If you want it back
Cause I need you bad
Come on and kiss me on my lips baby

I won't stress the fact
If you don't want me
Not like that
But I can't go
Cause I need you to stay
And I hope that you really know it baby

If you can't tell
If you can't see
Baby I'm the only one you need
Maybe you should know
Cause I'm about to leave
Cause this party ain't a party
It ain't droppin' no more

If you can't tell
If you can't see
Baby I'm the only one you need
Maybe you should know
Cause I'm about to leave
Cause this party ain't a party
It ain't droppin' no more

You never try
You never try
You say goodbye
You say goodbye

I need you most than I try
Most than I try
So baby why you do it again?
I'm gonna try
I'm gonna try to love you say goodbye
You say goodbye

But I need you most than I try
Most than I try
To be a better man

If you can't tell
If you can't see
Baby I'm the only one you need
Maybe you should know
Cause I'm about to leave
Cause this party ain't a party
It ain't droppin' no more

If you can't tell
If you can't see
Baby I'm the only one you need
Maybe you should know
Cause I'm about to leave
Cause this party ain't a party
It ain't droppin' no more

I don't mean nothing for you
Nothing for you baby
You ain't got nothing for me
No nothing for me baby
