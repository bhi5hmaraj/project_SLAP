Us Against The World 
Olly Murs

I've got the rhythm up in my head
It's beating slowly
Tell me will I see you again?
You came around and lifted my sky
You open my eyes and I can never close âem again
Hold back, I hold back
I don't play like that
I'm good, she is bad
And there's no way that I am leaving now
Hold back, you pull back
You don't play like that
You playing with my mind and I don't care

We got tonight so tell me your name
I'm going crazy, so come with me baby
Is us against the world

I'm watching your moves and I bring you games
Just stay with me baby
Is us against the world
Is us against the world
Is us against the world

Take me anywhere you want now
But don't you slow down
Cuz I don't wanna lose you again
I got a feeling and it's magic
So don't you hide it
Girl you help to settle the pain
Hold back, I pull back
I don't play like that
I'm good she is bad
And there's no way that I am leaving now
Hold back, you pull back
You don't play like that
You playing with my mind and I don't care

We got tonight so tell me your name
I'm going crazy, so come with my baby
Is us against the world
I'm watching your moves and I bring you games
Just stay with me baby
Is us against the world
Is us against the world
Is us against the world
Is us against the world

Don't know where you had it
Don't know if it's wrong
But darling you were right the way you belong
And I've been thinking, thinking to through
I really wanna be with you

We got tonight so tell me your name
I'm going crazy, so come with me baby
Is us against the world
I'm watching your moves and I bring you games
Just stay with me baby
Is us against the world
I play your game just no leave me this way
Is us against the world
Is us against the world
I play your game just no leave me this way
We're going to the top
Is us against the world
Is us against the world
Is us against the world
