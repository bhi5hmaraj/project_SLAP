Fair Game 
Sia

You terrify me
Cause you're a man- you're not a boy
You've got some power
And I can't treat you like a toy
The road less... Traveled by a little girl
You disregard the mess
While I try to control the world
Don't leave me
Stay here and frighten me
Don't leave me
Come now enlighten me
Give me all you got
Give me your wallet and your watch
Give me your first born
Give me the rainbow and the-
So go on and challenge me
Take the reigns and the seat
Watch me squirm baby
But you are just what I need
And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and nerve if
I can't respect any man
Yeah I want to play a fair game
Yeah I want to play a fair game

You terrify me
We've still not kissed
And yet I've cried
You got too close in
I pushed and pushed
Opened your bites
So I could run run
And then I did betray the dust
You saw those teeth marks
They weren't all yours
You had been trusted to a history
That had not worked for me
Into a history from which I could not face
So go on and shake me
Shake until I give it up
When I am in doubt baby
I know that we could make some love

So go on challenge me
Take the reigns and the seat
Watch me squirm baby
But you're just what I need
And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and nerve if
I can't respect any man
Yeah I want to play a fair game
Yeah I want to play a fair game
And I never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and nerve if
I can't respect any man
Yeah I want to play a fair game
Yeah I want to play a fair game

I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and nerve if
I can't respect any man
I want to play a fair game
Oh, I want to play a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
What good is intellect and nerve if
I can't respect any man
I want to play a fair game
