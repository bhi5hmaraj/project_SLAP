Fruition 
Dream

[Intro]
Yeah (x8)

[Verse 1]
Iâm always lost, deep in your eyes
You can tell me a million lies, and Iâd believe it
Iâd listen thoroughly time after time
âCos getting away with loving you is already my crime
You make me want to do what Iâm supposed to do
Once a choosey lover now they donât compare to you
Iâll do whatever always come back to me
Holding you close loving you endlessly

[Hook]
Itâs so hard, to find someone like you
Iâve searched under stars of many of moons
Just to find someone like you

Uh, Uh

[Verse 2]
Say whatever you want, youâre in charge
Iâll be right here when you need me, I wonât barge
In
Take your time I wonât be far
As long as Iâm close, to where you are
When Iâm with you, you are my world (my world)
Iâm in awe, youâre my girl (my girl)
What did I do to deserve this thing
Iâm holding you close loving you endlessly (endlessly)

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Some dreams can come to
Fruition, (Yeah)
Fruition, (Me and you baby baby)
Fruition
Now that I got you Iâll never let you go

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3]
And Iâll never let you go
Girl youâre embedded in my heart
Youâre tattooed to my soul
Canât tear us apart
Youâre the dearest thing in my mind
Itâs been so hard to find, someone, like you
I will never let you go

[Hook]

[Outro]
Dreams can come to
Fruitionâ¦ fruition
