Want To Want Me 
Jason DeRulo

(Derulo...)

It's so hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor
Listen to me
And I can't take it no more
So hard I can't breath
I got one foot out the door
Where are my keys?
'Cause I gotta leave, yeah

In the back of the cab
I tip the driver, head to town
Give me the best
I got your body on my mind
I want it back
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high

Girl, you don't want
I want you to want me
And if you want, hey girl, you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you

Girl, you don't want
I want you to want me
And if you want, hey girl, you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you
Just to get up next you

You open the door
There ain't nothing but a smile drawn to the floor
And you whisper in my ear, baby I'm yours
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high

Girl, you don't want
I want you to want me
And if you want, hey girl, you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you

Girl, you don't want
I want you to want me
And if you want, hey girl, you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you
Just to get up next you

Just the thought of you gets me so high, so high
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high

Girl, you don't want
I want you to want me
And if you want, hey girl, you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you

Girl, you don't want
I want you to want me
And if you want, hey girl, you got me
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Just to get up next you
Just to get up next you
