Stay Down 
Big Sean

[Hook] x2
My whole squad in this bitch
And they gon' stay there the whole night
I mix that shit with champagne
Been waitin' on that shit my whole life
Forever me and my dawgs
Yeah, nigga, you know right
Yeah, yeah, you know right
Yeah, yeah, you know right

[Refrain]
And they always stay down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
This for my dawgs, yeah my dawgs man that always stay
Down, down, down, down, down, down
Weed, money, liquor
I'ma drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown, drown

[Verse 1]
Ok, I ain't that fucked up but I'm half way
We came a long way from the L.A
Bad bad bad bitches they dressed up
Like its the NBA draft day and I bet
And I bet that she ain't gonna be that late
For a young sexy face like me
A young young young sexy face like me
She like girls if she don't like me
And if you do then I do girl, I see ya, I see ya
The way that you pose I might have to IG her
Sexy young thing I might have to ID her
Ooh damn I got some Ideas
We could fuck up the couch in the club like it came from Ikea
Goin' so hard the whole night is a blur
Older women be like damn your mature
I say you the one but God damn I got nerve

[Hook x2 + Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Ok, I sip the kamikaze while I bend the body
And I whip the Maserati like I'm Ricky Bobby
I be mobbin', I be mobbin' like I'm Gotti
I might even speak italian
50 women in the room like we ain't even got a lobby
I be wildin' like I never had the [?]
And the titties, paparazzi they be flashin'
God damnit I'm a hottie
Got her friends tryna fuck me
And her mans tryna rob me
And she won't leave me alone I tell the trick to get a hobby
I ain't even gonna lie I got a million dollar chick
With a billion dollar pussy
Everytime I cum I swear to God I feel like I be rich
Yeah, tryna get that hotel money
But you know them crackers ain't gonna let you get the Ritz
They ain't gonna let you get the fountain in the front with the fist
They gonna give you courtside at the Clips
But never on the shit, they ain't on that gunner shit
Well fuck giving it to me I'mma take that shit
Forget crackin' the code I'mma break that shit
I'mma calamari steak that shit
And cause so much ice, me and my dogs gonna skate that shit
Bitch do it so big you can't escape that shit
Hoes tryna have my baby just to Ricki Lake that shit
I hate that shit
Girls handing me their heart how could I not break that shit

[Hook + Refrain]
