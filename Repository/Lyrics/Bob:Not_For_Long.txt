Not For Long 
Bob

You will be mine
Even if you're somebody else's
But not for long
Girl not for long
'Cause I'm your type
If you got the wrong impression
Girl not for long
Girl not for long

Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow
Maybe at the club, maybe at the bar
I wanna show you off like a trophy car (whip it!)
Cause anything is better than nothing at all
Nothing at all, nothing on you
I just wanna show you a table for two
All you did was go on a date with a dude
You know him, he ain't tailored for you
You just on a nigga dick 'cause he sold a brick
Has he ever wrote a hit or some poet shit
That's who you chillin' on the sofa with?
I ain't trippin' in a minute I'll be over wit, aye

You will be mine
Even if you're somebody else's
But not for long
Girl not for long
'Cause I'm your type
If you got the wrong impression
Girl not for long
Girl not for long

But not for long
Girl not for long
Girl not for long

But not for long
Girl not for long

When they see us together
Hell no, they can't stand it
I wonder if you're matching your bras with them panties
A gorgeous skin tan
I hit the mall to do damage
They way she hit the high notes
We all gon' have Grammys
It's marble not granite
From the counter to the shower
For a hour super power, super power
That's that mojo, Austin Powers
Search real nigga, I'mma pop up in your browser, aye
So go on get your body wet
Panties off
We ain't made it to the lobby yet
Put you on game girl so it's obvious
I give you the world if you ain't got it yet

You will be mine
Even if you're somebody else's
But not for long
Girl not for long
'Cause I'm your type
If you got the wrong impression
Girl not for long
Girl not for long

But not for long
Girl not for long
Girl not for long

But not for long
Girl not for long

You might be with someone else
But I still see that you fiend a be with a G like me
You never need no one else
And I know, you know I
I'mma be like I told you so

You will be mine
Even if you're somebody else's
But not for long
Girl not for long
'Cause I'm your type
If you got the wrong impression
Girl not for long
Girl not for long

But not for long
Girl not for long
Girl not for long

But not for long
Girl not for long
