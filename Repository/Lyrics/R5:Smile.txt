Smile 
R5

Today I feel like running naked through your street
To get your attention
â(To get your attention)
Whoa-oh-oh
â(Whoa-oh-oh)
I broke up with my girl so tell me where to meet
Oh, did I mention?
â(Oh, did I mention?)
Whoa-oh-oh
â(Whoa-oh-oh)

I dream on, dream about you
What can I do to make you feel all right?
Baby I don't want to see you cry, no-oh

I want to see you smile
I want to see you smile

Today I feel like blowing all my cash on you
I'd buy you anything
â(I'd buy you anything)
âUntil I'm broke
(Until I'm broke broke)
Today I want to turn your skies from gray to blue
And if it rains on you
âI'll be your coat
Whoa-oh-oh

I dream on, dream about you
What can I do to make you feel all right?
Baby, I don't want to see you cry, no-oh

I want to see you smile
I want to see you smile

Let me take your picture, baby
I'll save it for a rainy day
I don't need much
I guess I'm just old fashioned in that way
So on the count of three, let's see you
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3!

Smile
(I wanna make you smile yeah oh oh)
I wanna see you smile (oh yeah)
I wanna see you smile

It's the things you do
I wanna make you smile
