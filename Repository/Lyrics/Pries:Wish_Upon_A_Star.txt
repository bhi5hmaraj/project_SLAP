Wish Upon A Star 
Pries

I've been wishing on a star
'Cause a nigga needed all
With the hoes, with the clothes, with a brand new car
Fuck that, I just wanna see all my niggas ball
I've been wishing on a star
'Cause a nigga needed all
It's not enough, it's not enough
With the hoes, with the clothes, with a brand new car
Fuck that, I just wanna see all my niggas ball
It's not enough, it's not enough
It's not enough, it's not enough

For my niggas on the block
Tryina make it out there
Tryina get it out there, mind bottles with the rock
Whippering clear, whip, whip,
Got a??? All my girls on the pole
Shake it there yeah, shake it there yeah
'Cause I really got it on
No war in the chaos, no war in the chaos how we used to
Used to get shot down, [?]
I used to speak for the crane going up town
'Cause nobody really wants to be downtown, no, no
Hundred girls who are try to climb
Hundred slain once laying in the night gown
Trying to give in the brain, give me the chain
Tears in the drain, I'm just tryina lay this pipe down, no, no
Can you pray for a nigga?
Here's a room full of nigga
If I start drinking, this figure will my wallet get bigger?
How much for a sinner? No
All my people need work
And my aunties still live in the church
Say I need prayer so I bought a few hands
I hope that y'all here to help me jump there

I've been wishing on a star
'Cause a nigga needed all
With the hoes, with the clothes, with a brand new car
Fuck that, I just wanna see all my niggas ball
I've been wishing on a star
'Cause a nigga needed all
It's not enough, it's not enough
With the hoes, with the clothes, with a brand new car
Fuck that, I just wanna see all my niggas ball
It's not enough, it's not enough
It's not enough, it's not enough
I've been wishing, I've been praying
I've been wishing, I've been praying
I've been wishing, I've been praying
I've been wishing, I've been praying
I've been wishing, I've been praying
