Let Me Through 
T-Pain

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Now I'm just sitting here at this red light with my emergency brake on
The wheels spinnin', whip looking like it got new skates on
I'm talking 9. 8 seconds boy, this ain't gonna take long
Then I hop out at the finish line like "is this what you waitin' on?"
I'll tell you what, homie, you ain't gotta take long
Thinkin' bout this trophy I'mma take home
Give 'em something to hate on
Confetti all over the place, girls poppin' out that cake holmes
And my skin tone should be the only thing you asking me about race holmes
Yea, I'mma tell you what you not gonna do
Cause if the wing gonna pop out the back of that Ferrari
Then the Bugatti got one too
I'm tryna throw these great balls of fire, I'm talking wu-bablabum
Jesus Christ, feel like I got two Bibles out, zoom-zoom
And I'm like

[Hook: T-Pain]
And I'm like hold up, hold up, you gotta let me through
Yea, you gotta let me through
And I stay right, you gotta let me through
I'mma slide, so you gotta let them too
And my niggas slide

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I got too much rubber to burn, fire hazard
Lil Tune, the tycoon
Cash Money mascot, it's hot under this costume
Got pedals I've never stepped on
Buttons I've never pressed on
Backseats I've never effed on
Police, they'll get the F bomb
I still ride with my niggas, money don't change a gangster
And when I'm asked to pull a few strings
I pull 'em til they untangle
Watch me donuts as she throw up like hell yeah
More money, more problems, I'm surprised I still have black hair
I feel like racing racing, who racing?
Don't give up the location
And if we bet, I went and hit the strip club
And go throw at them pole babies
Riding so fast with the top down
The wind sound like a standing ovation
Tunechi, fast and furious, I like my bitch fast and flirtatious

[Hook: T-Pain]
And I'm like hold up, hold up, you gotta let me through
Yea, you gotta let me through
And I stay right, you gotta let me through
I'mma slide, so you gotta let them too
And my niggas slide
