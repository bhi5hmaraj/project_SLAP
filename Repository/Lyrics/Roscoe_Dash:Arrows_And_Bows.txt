Arrows And Bows 
Roscoe Dash

Hold onto your hearts, if you can
It's been the coldest year since records began
And now the sun is coming up again in no man's land

So let's go, into tomorrow
Together fighting
We're bows and arrows

You and me on the front line
You and me, every time
It's always you and me, we're bows and arrows
Yeah

Well I'm not waiting for no one, I'm waiting for you
Well I'm not waiting for no one, I'm waiting for you
It takes the two of us together, if we'll make it through

So let's go, into tomorrow
Together fighting
We're bows and arrows

You and me on the front line
You and me, every time
It's always you and me, we're bows and arrows
Yeah
You and me when the sun goes down
It's always you and me when the whip comes round
It's always you and me, we're bows and arrows
