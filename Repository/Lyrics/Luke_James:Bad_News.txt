Bad News 
Luke James

I'm so lonely
Lonely for only you
See these stars they told me
We run like bad news
And when I'm all alone
And there's no one here to do
I have my fight,
And you should leave
That makes for bad news
Trust me
Love tells us there's no mercy, no no no
Love tells us there's no mercy
I want what I want
I need what I need
So why can't one please me!
No no no,
Love tells us there's no mercy
No no no
I'm so lonely,
Lonely for only you
There's a note to how you own me
Pass me, only to be used
When I'm all alone
And there's no one here to do
I have my fight,
And you should leave
That makes for bad news
Trust me
Love tells us there's no mercy, no no no
Love tells us there's no mercy
I want what I want
I need what I need
So why can't one please me!
No no no,
Love tells us there's no mercy
No no no
No no no
No no no
(Give it all to me, give it all to me
Do it all for me
Give it all to me, give it all to me
Do it all for me)
Love tells us there's no mercy
No no no
People loving you this way
I'ma follow where you darling down
(Get off of me, get off of me
Do it all for me)
You should know my mind,
So I'll wait here
Yeah, oh you
(Do it all for me, do it all for me)
Love tells us there's no mercy
No no no
Love tells us there's no mercy
No no no
I want what I want
I need what I need
So why can't one please me!
No no no,
Love tells us there's no mercy
No no no
(Do it all for me, do it all for me
Do it all for me, do it all for me
Give it all to me, give it all to me)
Love tells us there's no mercy
No no no
Don't I deserve it?
Don't I deserve it!
