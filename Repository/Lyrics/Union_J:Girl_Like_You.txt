Girl Like You 
Union J

Well, I'm not the kind of guy you show to your mother
(Ooh)
'Cause when I got somebody, I'm looking for another
(Ooh)
I only know how to play it cool
But you're the exception to the rule
'Cause with lips like that, any guy's gonna suffer
(Ooh)

And it makes me wonder
What is a girl like you doing in a mind like mine?
I could show a girl like you how to have a real good time
Don't wanna imagine, I just wanna have you
More than in my head tonight
So, what is a girl like you doing in a mind like mine?

Let me show you all the ways that we can get in trouble
(Ooh)
(Oh my god, I can't believe we just did that!)
We could go all night, regret it by tomorrow
(Ooh)
I only know how to walk away
But here with you I just wanna stay
'Cause a single shot of you makes a guy want a double
(Ooh)

And I have to wonder
What is a girl like you doing in a mind like mine?
I could show a girl like you how to have a real good time
Don't wanna imagine, I just wanna have you
More than in my head tonight
So, what is a girl like you doing in a mind like mine?

(Ooh, what is a girl)
What is a girl like you doing in a mind like mine?
I could show a girl like you how to have a real good time

And it makes me wonder
What is a girl like you doing in a mind like mine?
I could show a girl like you how to have a real good time
Don't wanna imagine, I just wanna have you
More than in my head tonight
So, what is a girl like you doing in a mind like mine?
Don't wanna imagine, I just wanna have you
More than in my head tonight
So, what is a girl like you doing in a mind like mine?
(What is a girl)
