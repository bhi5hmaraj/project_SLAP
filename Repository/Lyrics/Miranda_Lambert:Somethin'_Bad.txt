Somethin' Bad 
Miranda Lambert

[Both:]
Stand on the box,
Stomp your feet,
Get clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh

[Miranda Lambert:]
Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up,
Couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen

[Carrie Underwood:]
Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window,
Where you heading to next?
Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out of the mattress
Got a feeling something bad about to happen...

[Chorus:]
Stand on the box, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming,
Throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning' don't know what happened
Whoooah... Something bad
Whoooah... Something bad

[Carrie Underwood:]
Now me and that girl that I met on the street
We're rollin' down the road,
Down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out of the mattress
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen

[Miranda Lambert:]
Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
Just like a real-life Thelma & Louise
If the cops catch up,
They're gonna call it kidnapping
Got a real good feelin' something bad about to happen

[Chorus:]
Stand on the box, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning' don't know what happened
Whoooah... Something bad
Whoooah... Something bad

[Both:]
Stand on the box, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Now the drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning' don't know what happened
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoooah... Something bad
Whoooah... Something bad
