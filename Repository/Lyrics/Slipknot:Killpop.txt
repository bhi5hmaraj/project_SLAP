Killpop 
Slipknot

She's sticking needles in her skin
I turn with another grin
Her canvas doesn't leave a lot to fantasy
But her peace of mind can't stay inside the lines
It's so confusing, the methods that she's using.
She knows she shouldn't leave a mark that I can see
Will she ever find, wondering of a kind
It's cold and lonely, but that's because she told me
Lost inside her dirty world
No one hurts this pretty girl but her

No, she's beautiful
A little better than a man deserves
You are not insane
Please tell me she won't change

Maybe I should let her go
I only wish she loves me
(She loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me

She's drowning in herself again
My god, what a lovely sin
I guess there's nothing left do
But have my way
She can feel it's right
So she doesn't close her eyes
She smiles and answers
Doesn't seem to matter

Lost inside my dirty head
Something tells me I'm the one who's killed

Loud, so volatile
A little better than a man to fail
Who I need to be
Please tell me she won't change

Maybe I should let her go
I only wish she loves me
(She loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me.

We were meant
To be together
Now die and fucking love me
We were meant to hate each other
Now die and fucking love me

Die and fucking love me
Die and fucking love me
Die and fucking love me.
