Ew! 
Jimmy Fallon

Seriously? Look at her butt. Ew
Oh, she looks like a slut. Ew
I'm like "what the what"? Ew
Right? Right? Ew, ew

Oh, you got to see this
Oh my gross I can't believe it
She's so basically basic
She's literally making me sick

This is embarrassing. Ew, ew
Like seriously, seriously. Ew, ew
No seriously, seriously Ew, ew
I can't, I can't Ew, ew

Look at look at this. OM-effin-G, what the eff?
You're gonna freaking flip, like, seriously freaking flip
Cause Sally's mad at Iggy because Iggy's booty's more biggy
And Sally's booty's twiggy so she called her friend Cybie
Now Sally's gonna get impleggies
What's impleggies? Implants, silly. Ew
I'm freaking for real
I think silicone butts are ew, ew

Where'd she get that outfit? Ew
That girl is totally ratchet. Ew
No seriously â who likes that? Ew
Right right? Ew, ew

Look at the way she takes pics
And what's up with those duck lips?
She's so lame
Super lame. Ew, ew

This is embarrassing. Ew, ew
Like seriously seriously. Ew, ew
No, seriously seriously. Ew, ew
Oh my gosh. Ew, ew

[Bridge, Will.I.Am]
I am not hating
I am merely conversating
With my BFF Sara
So bust your rhyme, Sara.

[Verse 2, Jimmy Fallon and Will.I.Am]
It's mir.I.am and you know who
Now here's some things I think are ew
FaceTime and reclining in
Airplane seats and then Vining
Retweeting tweets I'm not lying
Cause even rhyming's ann-iy-ing
Bread bowls and ravioli
Casserole, a roly poly
Caterpillar on my really old
And moldy windowsill. Ew
Trapper keepers and a creeper wearin
Sneakers with the toes
And maybe Frozen cuz
You knowing I don't
Wanna build a snowman. Ew, ew

Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew

Hello my name is Sara
That's Sara with no "H"
Too bad if you don't like it
Cause haters gonna
Hate my Stepdad Gary
He tries to act so cool
Every time we see him
My friends and I say "Ew"

Hey funky bunch, what're you guys doing?

Oh my gosh, it's my step dad Gary
And he just ruined it

I heard that funky beat that you were playing down here
It's a party over here
It's a party over here

Ew
