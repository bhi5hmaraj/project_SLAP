Reflection 
Fifth Harmony

[Verse:]
I must confess
You looking fresh
Yeah I'm impressed
Go 'head and flex
Everybody be hating the way that you stealing the show
Cause boy you be killing it just like little Terio

[Verse 2:]
You can get, anything you want
And can't nobody, telling you no
Don't need no filters on pictures before you post them on the gram
Shut down the internet, they don't even understand

[Pre-Chorus:]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I never met a guy like you
No, no, oh, oh, oh, oh
It ain't nothing if you always true

[Chorus:]
Boy where you from?
Must be heaven
You'd be rich, looking good
It's your profession
Think I'm love, cause you're so s***
Boy, I ain't talking about you, I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection, I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talking about you, I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection, I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talking about you, I'm talking to my own reflection

[Verse 3:]
Why'd you think I'm putting on my favorite perfume?
Why'd you think this dress so tight and I can barely move?
Why'd you think I'm dancing in these uncomfortable shoes?
I did it all, I did it all, I did it all for you!

[Pre-Chorus:]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't you ever get it confused
No, no, oh, oh, oh, oh
It everything they know is true

[Chorus:]
Boy where you from?
Must be heaven
You'd be rich, looking good
It's your profession
Think I'm love, cause you're so s***
Boy, I ain't talking about you, I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection, I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talking about you, I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection, I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talking about you, I'm talking to my own reflection

[Bridge x4]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Should I even return his call?

[Chorus:]
Boy where you from?
Must be heaven
You'd be rich, looking good
It's your profession
Think I'm love, cause you're so s***
Boy, I ain't talking about you, I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection, I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talking about you, I'm talking to my own reflection
I'm talking to my own reflection, I'm talking to my own reflection
Boy, I ain't talking about you, I'm talking to my own reflection
