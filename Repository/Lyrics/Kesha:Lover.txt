Lover 
Kesha

[Verse:]
Lover
Why don't you come over?
You know it's after midnight
You know it's after midnight
Lover
Where did I remember?
You since the beginning
You since the beginning

[Chorus:]
Lover
You've already broken my heart
You've already broken my heart
Why have you stayed?
Why have you stayed
Cause lover
You've already ripped me apart
You've already broken my heart
What would it take, to make you walk away?

[Post-Chorus:]
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away

[Verse 2:]
Here we sit
In these restless mornings
You held on tight last night
Then you ever had before
Here we sit
In these restless mornings
You held on tight last night
Then you ever had before
Then you ever had before

[Chorus:]
Lover
You've already broken my heart
You've already broken my heart
Why have you stayed?
Why have you stayed
Cause lover
You've already ripped me apart
You've already broken my heart
What would it take, to make you walk away?

[Post-Chorus:]
Walk away
Walk away
Walk away

[Chorus:]
Lover
You've already broken my heart
You've already broken my heart
Why have you stayed?
Why have you stayed
Cause lover
You've already ripped me apart
You've already broken my heart
What would it take, to make you walk away?

[Post-Chorus:]
Walk away
Walk away
Just walk away

[Outro:]
Lover (walk away)
Lover (walk away)
Lover
