Jackie And Wilson 
Hozier

Dog tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
So deep in the swill with the most familiar swine
For reasons raptured and divine

She blows out of nowhere, roman candle of wild
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would pretend to be tonight
Cause Lord she found me just in time

Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt
Cause Lord I never felt young
She's gonna save me, call me baby, run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily, actually she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detective's, ride around picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson, raise em on rhythm and blues

Lord it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
Sit back and watch the world go by

Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust
We tried to be in the world, good god it wasn't for us
She's gonna save me, call me baby, run her hands through my hair
We'll still her Lexus, be detectives, ride around picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson, raise em on rhythm and blues

Cut clean from the dream at night let my mind reset
Looking up from my cigarette, she's already left
Start digging in the yard for what's left of me in our little vinette
For whatever poor soul is coming next

She's gonna save me, call me baby, run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily, actually she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives, ride around picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson, raise em on rhythm and blues
