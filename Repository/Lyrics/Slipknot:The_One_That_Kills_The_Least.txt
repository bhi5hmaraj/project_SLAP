The One That Kills The Least 
Slipknot

I don't seem to care today
I mirror what I love with what I hate
Empty ways can cloud your eyes
I only know because I tried
So come with me, come with me

Let's meet our contestants
there's no better time to play the game

I don't want to give it away. underneath the citadels
buried deep with your guilt and regrets
Leading in the dark, everything is wonderful
I don't care, I don't want to forget
What is it a crime? It's none of your business
I prefer to be in hell by myself
Turn the other cheek and tell it to sombody who refuses to forgive
when nothing was taken

No one else survives- I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes - alone in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all

Hidden in the rubble, everybody's got a story to tell
What do I need, eliminate the possible.
All that's left is a man in a cell
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe a decision is
better way to go, a better way to be
I've got my demons, go get your own
Save another number, don't forget to hate me

No one else survives-I; ve seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes - Alone in here, I realized
The one that kills the still kills us all

No one else survives - I've seen you live, now watch me die
but we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes - Alone in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all
The one that kills the least still kills us all
The one that kills the least still kills us ALL...
ALL... ALL... ALL
