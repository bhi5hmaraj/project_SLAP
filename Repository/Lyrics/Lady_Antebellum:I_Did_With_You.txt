I Did With You 
Lady Antebellum

I remember thinking 'bout forever
Sitting there with you by the river
We danced in the little lights
And felt for the first time

I remember telling you I loved you
Northern star right above you
And in a moment I thought every dream
Would come true
Oh, we'll built some just never do

Love comes in circles
And love takes it's own time
Bending and breaking, not taking the street line
I never knew I never loved timeless and true
Oh, I did, yeah I did with you.
Oh, I did, I did with you.

Through the years just kept on the leading
Had to be a plan or a reason

But Heaven was silent and life just kept moving on
'Till my heart knew the moment was gone

Love comes in circles
And love takes it's own time
Bending and breaking, not taking the street line
I never knew I never loved timeless and true
Oh, I did, yeah I did with you

Love is the reason why
Miracles never die

They just live on and on
Like a song, like a song
In the hearts of ones you leave behind
Ooh, yeah

Love comes in circles
And love takes it's own time
Bending and breaking, not taking the street line
I never knew I never loved timeless and true
Oh, I did, yeah I did with you.
Oh, I did, I did with you.
