Roar 
Katy Perry

I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sit quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready cause Iâve had enough
I see it all, I see it now

Chorus:
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion and youâre gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion and youâre gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Youâre gonna hear me roar

Now Iâm floatin like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

You held me down, but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready âcause Iâve had enough
I see it all, I see it now

Chorus:
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion and youâre gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion and youâre gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Youâre gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Youâre gonna hear me roar
Roar-or, roar-or, roar-or

I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion and youâre gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion and youâre gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Youâre gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Youâre gonna hear me roar
