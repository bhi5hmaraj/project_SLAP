Walk 
Kwabs

[Intro]
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught down
And then I'll be falling all the way down

[Verse 1]
Hundred headlights making me blind
All of your pleasures catching my eye
If I jump once then I never think twice
But your temptations making me stay another night
And my senses only lie to me, lie to me
I don't know how it fell so raw to me, raw to me
I gotta check myself before I get what I want
Find out it's not what I thought it was
And you know I

[Hook]
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out
And then I'll be falling all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
Cause if I don't walk, I can't even sit around
And I'll be falling all the way down

[Verse 2]
Tell myself leave, while I'm still strong
Going on back till I'm ten miles gone
And when the road stops, I'm gonna keep on
Until I end up in the place that I belong
But the pressure's pushing me back again
Telling me not to pretend
There's even use even trying to get you out my head
So I lift my feet off the ground
And I'm gonna walk right up

[Hook]
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out
And then I'll be falling all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
Cause if I don't walk, I can't even sit around
And I'll be falling all the way down

[Bridge]
Won't get caught in the old fly trap
Run away, run away, never come back
No way I'm going down like that
No, no, run away, run away

Won't get caught in the old fly trap
Run away, run away, never come back
No way I'm going down like that
No, no, run away, run away

[Hook]
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out
And then I'll be falling all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right
Cause if I don't walk, I can't even sit around
And I'll be falling all the way down

I'm better walk now
I'm better walk now
Yeah, no, no, no
Better walk
Yeah, no, no, no
