Lonely Girl 
Weezer

My lonely girl
My lonely girl
Lonely girl
My lonely girl

So baby come on
I know how to dance
Why'm I the only one who ever takes a chance?
So give it a try
You're not gonna die
Unless you refuse to live in higher way tonight.

I'm lonely, So hold me
Can't you relieve?

So open your arms
And let me come in
I'd never hurt you girl cuz I would be a sin.

I'm lonely, So hold me
Can't you relieve?

I'm hurtin, I'm worthy
Can't you relieve?

I know I'm scared
I know I'm sad
I needed your help to realize it's not so bad.

So open you're arms
And let me come in
I'd never hurt you girl cuz I would be a sin.

My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
