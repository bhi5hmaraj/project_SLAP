Bow Down 
BeyoncÃ©

I'm at that H town, coming, coming down, I'm coming down
Drippin' candy on the ground
H town, I'm coming down, coming down
Drippin' candy on the ground

I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down, b-tches

I took some time to live my life
But donât think Iâm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my sh-t

Bow down, b-tches
Bow down, b-tches
Bow down, b-tches
Bow down, b-tches

H-town bishes, H-H-town bishes

I'm so crowned, bow, bow down b-tches

I'm at that H town, coming, coming down, I'm coming down
Drippin' candy on the ground
H-H town-town, I'm coming down,
C-C-Coming down, drippin' candy on the ground
