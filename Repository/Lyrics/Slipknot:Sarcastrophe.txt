Sarcastrophe 
Slipknot

[Verse:]
Wallow in the winter of it
Discover what you truly covet
Underneath the floor, above it
You slither and I'll get a chance
How could you forget about it?
Did you think you could minimize?
This is the age of consent
You'll get a day in this life
Before I kill your fucking light
Burn open your atmosphere
Burn up in your atmosphere
Desecrate your temples
Only I'll end the name I've made
Don't look for crows, they're scattered
Prepare for judgment day

We are killed gods

[Verse 2:]
The gates are falling down
Can I find a way to get there?
Bury your head in the ground
When you falsify for your fair share
Which god is god plus negative one?
It's everybody's deaths but they have only one
Will you come testify in the court of myopic opinion?
Or will you settle for oblivion?

We are killed gods

[Chorus:]
(We)
We make this world worth saving (Are)
Are you prepared to believe? (Killed)
Kill everything that kills you (Gods)
Live long and die for me

[Verse 3:]
You write, [?]
In the middle of a novelist pact
They will never obey
All these years spent hiding all the bodies
I could never be sure but I remember the graves

We are killed gods

[Chorus:]
(We)
We make this world worth saving (Are)
Are you prepared to believe? (Killed)
Kill everything that kills you (Gods)
Live long and die for me

[Outro:]
Live long and die for me
Live long and die for me
