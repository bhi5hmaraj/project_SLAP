Homegrown Honey 
Darius Rucker

Sitting at a bar in New York City
Everybody here looking New York pretty
But you're that kinda girl that's got that something
Dancing to the groove like it just ain't nothing
They ain't never seen nothing quite like you
Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
Girl there ain't nothing harder

Uh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down in your roots
How did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I'll take a sip of that smile
I'll bet the boys at home can't leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You're so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you're just so homegrown

Trying to think of something cool to say
Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying: âSon it's on!â
And we were dancing all night long
To a sweet old Alabama song

Uh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down in your roots
How did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I'll take a sip of that smile
I'll bet the boys at home can't leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You're so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you're just so homegrown

Ooh baby, baby, baby
You driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
I'm a long way away from where I'm from
But baby you feel like home

Uuh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down in your roots
How did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I'll take a sip of that smile
I'll bet the boys at home can't leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You're so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you're just so homegrown

Honey, honey, honey
You're so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you're just so homegrown
