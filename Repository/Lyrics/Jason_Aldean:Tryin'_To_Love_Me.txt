Tryin' To Love Me 
Jason Aldean

[Verse:]
I thought you were just being a girl
The kind that just wants to change me
Likes to find all my flaws
Thought I had you figured out
I told myself she's crazy
Man, was I ever wrong
The whole time you were just trying to love me

[Chorus:]
I pushed and you pulled
Should have just fell into you
But I did what I always do, I always do
Wanted to talk but I walked away
Didn't want to hear what you had to say
Stupid me, can't believe I never knew
The whole time you were just trying to love me

[Verse 2:]
Didn't think those tears were real
Thought you were just trying to play me
I just stood there and let em fall
You were just loving me after all

[Chorus:]
I pushed and you pulled
Should have just fell into you
But I did what I always do, I always do
Wanted to talk but I walked away
Didn't want to hear what you had to say
Stupid me, can't believe I never knew
The whole time you were just trying to love me

[Outro:]
Wanted to talk but I walked away
Didn't want to hear what you had to say
Stupid me, I can't believe I never knew, I never knew
The whole time you were just trying
The whole time you were just trying
To love me
Trying to love me
