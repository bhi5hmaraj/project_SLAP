Tell Me 
Vita Chambers

You got a face (face)
You got a face like Heaven, but your eyes are dark
And then they're so electric, you shot me down
Give me a reason, I'm afraid I might stay

[Pre-Chorus:]
It got so amazing, I can't look away
I can't look away

Tell me (tell me)

Woah, uuh-uuh
Woah, uuh-uuh

[Chorus:]
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep in my
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep
Down and go deep in my soul

You got a face (face)
The bottom of the bottle
You have me split and drown
Your voice so sweet, so sweet
With every sip you make me kinda drown [?]

[Pre-Chorus:]
You're amazing, I can't look away
I can't look away

Tell me (tell me)

Woah, uuh-uuh
Woah, uuh-uuh

[Chorus:]
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep in my
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep
Down and go deep in my soul

You got a face like Heaven
You shot me down, bang-bang

Tell me

[Chorus:]
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep
Down and go deep in my soul

Ooh-ooh, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh, deep, deep
Ooh-ooh,
Ooh-ooh,
Ooh-ooh,
Tell me
