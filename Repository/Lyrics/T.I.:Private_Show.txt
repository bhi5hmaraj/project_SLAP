Private Show 
T.I.

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Girl take it off for me, you know just what I want
It's always hard to leave, this private show
Let me see it, see it, let me see it take it off
Let me see it take it off, take it off (let me)
Let me see it take it off, take it off

[Verse 1: T. I.]
Shawty let me see you take it off, toot it up
Back into me, pass it to me
Imagine hanging half way off the mattress while your ass is moving
Up and down, back and forth, so ratchet when you supposed to be
A lady to the naked eye, but a nasty lil' hold of me
If only the masses could see your ass when it's in action, I swear
Manhandle you and pullin' places, I make you take it right here
You got no idea, listen girl with this pole right here, ow
Beat it up, be grabbin' hair
Leavin' hand prints on your derriÃ¨re
Now, can you, just kiss it for me while I'm doin' 'bout a hundred on the
highway
Get it, slap it wet, get it bent, girl I bet you could finish before I pull up
on the driveway
And this ain't no child play, this grown man [?] girl I'll say
I got your ass in the scope, ain't gotta be close shawty I could your pussy
from a mile away

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Girl take it off for me, you know just what I want
It's always hard to leave, this private show
Let me see it, see it, let me see it take it off
Let me see it take it off, take it off (let me)
Let me see it take it off, take it off

[Verse 2: T. I.]
Hey let me see you take it off, lay it down
Like this my last day in town
I'm puttin' in work no playin' around
But shawty I'm sayin', now
Me let you walk away without walkin' funny
Be talkin' bout me, I highly doubt it
So, let me take you to a private island
Make you take this dick, don't cry about it
How it feel to you girl? Don't lie about it, no
Shawty you ain't gotta lie about it
Blackin' out in that pussy like a power outage
Got a man, well he gon' be our about it
But I just wanna be on your team
Provide you with your protein
Leave wet dreams all in your face
Them tattoos all over your waist
Got me [?] silent, can't touch that
I'm fuckin' you like I'm upset
Chockin' you, long stroking you
Say you came twice, not enough yet
Because a cat that ft is very rare
And my dick ought to be buried there
I love how you kick it in public
But in private, we on some wild shit

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Girl take it off for me, you know just what I want
It's always hard to leave, this private show
Let me see it, see it, let me see it take it off
Let me see it take it off, take it off (let me)
Let me see it take it off, take it off

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Made a reservation, you're my favorite place to be
All day, contemplatin' baby, waitin' patiently
There's nobody like you, body way you climb on top of me
We're in hell and lady you're the closest thing to heavenly
I want you all to myself, nothing at all, I can't help it
Cause what you go on is fly as hell, but I need a better view
Just show me the real you

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Girl take it off for me, you know just what I want
It's always hard to leave, this private show
Let me see it, see it, let me see it take it off
Let me see it take it off, take it off (let me)
Let me see it take it off, take it off
