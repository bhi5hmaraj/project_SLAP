Mourning Doves 
Mikky Ekko

Look at how far we've come
Look at this mess we've made
I'm still praying at the sun
Tears my body from the shade
Tell me that we're too far gone
Tell me that we'll be ok
Swear to God I'd leave right now if
Heaven wasn't so far away

But this is not an exercise
And nobody gets out alive
Stop. What if I, what if I
Stop.

Mourning doves meet me in the morning
Love what if I what if I
Die before you wake
Promise I, promise you can lean on me
Lean on me
I can be your soldier
There's still room for us to pull over
But we can't stop, until the morning love
We can be together like mourning doves

Yeah realize that no escape
Releases you for your mistakes
This is not a warning but innocence is calling
In the sense that it's a fallen embrace

But this is not an exercise
And nobody gets out alive
Stop. What if I, what if I
Stop.

Mourning doves meet me in the morning
Love what if I what if I
Die before you wake
Promise I, promise you can lean on me
Lean on me
I can be your soldier
There's still room for us to pull over
But we can't stop, until the morning love
We can be together like mourning doves

Cause we both know we're running out of time
We're running out of time
We're running out of time
We're running out of time
Listen, we're out of time
Listen
Listen
Listen

Mourning doves meet me in the morning
Love what if I what if I
Die before you wake
Promise I, promise you can lean on me
Lean on me
I can be your soldier
There's still room for us to pull over
But we can't stop, until the morning love
We can be together like mourning doves
