Nude Beach A-Go-Go 
Azealia Banks

[Intro:]
Teenage Marooner, sipping Coca Cola
Teenage Marooner, mama can't control her

[Verse:]
Nude Beach A-Go-Go, Nude Beach A-Go-Go
You can do anything at Nude Beach A-Go-Go
Ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong, surfer Billy, bing-bong
Nude Beach A-Go-Go, Nude Beach A-Go-Go
You can tag along, if you're only strong
Nude Beach A-Go-Go, Nude Beach A-Go-Go
Black women attraction, all the white girls join in the action
Do your jingle when you jingle-jangle
Everybody just a bingle-bangle
Nude Beach A-Go-Go, Nude Beach A-Go-Go

[Hook: Azealia Banks & Ariel Pink]
Don't you, don't you know, know
Suntan in the snow, snow
Everybody goes where the roses bloom
Come and enjoy the living rooms
By the lifeguard station by the coral reefs
Hallelujah, Heaven, Hell, and all in between
There's no clothes to wear
And there's summer in the air
Chiffon and silk and wool and cotton, they all are forgotten

Teenage Marooner, sipping Coca Cola
Teenage Marooner, mama can't control her
Nude Beach A-Go-Go, Nude Beach A-Go-Go

[Hook: Azealia Banks & Ariel Pink]
Don't you, don't you know, know
Suntan in the snow, snow
Everybody goes where the roses bloom
Come and enjoy the living rooms
By the lifeguard station by the coral reefs
Hallelujah, Heaven, Hell, and all in between
There's no clothes to wear
And there's summer in the air
Chiffon and silk and wool and cotton, they all are forgotten

[Outro:]
At Nude Beach A-Go-Go, ah
