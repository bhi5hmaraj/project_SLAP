Little Things 
Tinashe

What if I told you I was true?
If I told you that I could do it better?
What if I told you I was true?

What if I told you that you need to forget her?
Tell me about the little things, the little things
That I know I could do better
The little things, the little things
That I know I could do
The little things, the little things
That I know I could do better
The little things, the little things
That I know I could do

We can keep it on the low
I need to take it slow
I'm a real one
Aint tellin no one
I'm going down

Where you gonna be?
You got a thing on me
We can have fun
I aint tellin no one
Trust me

You want this?
Get up, get up
I keep it better
All that was with us, with us
Youre a flyin ass nigga, nigga

What if I told you I was true?
If I told you that I could do it better?
What if I told you I was true?

What if I told you that you need to forget her?
Tell me about the little things, the little things
That I know I could do better
The little things, the little things
That I know I could do
The little things, the little things
That I know I could do better
The little things, the little things
That I know I could do

The niggaz do revenge
So I am with the gang
We can get down
Make the people sit down
An tell her it aint gonna change

You love the things I do
And how I'm ready to
I never quit
Nigga youre the shit now
I always keep it cool

You want this?
Get up, get up
I keep it better
All that was with us, with us
Youre a flyin ass nigga, nigga

What if I told you I was true?
If I told you that I could do it better?
What if I told you I was true?

What if I told you that you need to forget her?
Tell me about the little things, the little things
That I know I could do better
The little things, the little things
That I know I could do
The little things, the little things
That I know I could do better
The little things, the little things
That I know I could do
