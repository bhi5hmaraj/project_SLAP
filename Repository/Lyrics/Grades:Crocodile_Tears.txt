Crocodile Tears 
Grades

[Intro:]
So sick of crocodile tears
Tears, crocodile tear

[Verse:]
You could pretend we, had this stuff for days
You say you've been home crying, in your pillow case

[Bridge:]
Your back, I'mma be the type who tries apologies[?] And I
Know it all by heart
Your mouth is a conveyor belt of I'm so sorry
I need help, and I, this is how we part

[Pre-Chorus:]
Cuz I'm so sick of please don't go
I've had enough of Us, us
So sick of need you so
I've had enough of Us, us
Why don't you turn off the crocodile tears
Honestly save them for someone who cares
Cuz I'm so sick of please don't go
I've had enough of Us, us
So sick of

[Chorus: X2]
Crocodile tears
So sick of crocodile tears
Tears, crocodile tear

[Verse 2:]
You say you'll be there for me, sittin' by yourself
You should of that before you, slept with someone else

[Bridge:]
Your back, I'mma be the type who tries give me peace And I
Know it all by heart
Your mouth is a conveyor belt of it meant nothing
You just felt so bad
I'm a minute I'm not mad

[Pre-Chorus:]
Cuz I'm so sick of please don't go
I've had enough of Us, us
So sick of need you so
I've had enough of Us, us
Why don't you turn off the crocodile tears
Honestly save them for someone who cares
Cuz I'm so sick of please don't go
I've had enough of Us, us
So sick of

[Chorus: X2]
Crocodile tears
So sick of crocodile tears
Tears, crocodile tear
