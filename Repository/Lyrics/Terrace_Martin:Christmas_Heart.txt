Christmas Heart 
Terrace Martin

Outside I see people laughing, holding hands and standing close
But I feel my world collapsing while I sit here all alone
What would I gve for this wish start tonight
Saint Christas hope to my hear, make it right

Christmas, made my broken heart
Christmas, I need a bring new start
And even money can't find and sorry can't give
I want a new life, this can't be the end
Christmas made my broken heart

Family together, joist moment
Open presents by the tree
So much loving and wrapped emotion
But how's busy loving me?
Where do I belong, hear my song throw my cries,
Shine down you lied Christmas time make it right

Christmas, made my broken heart
Christmas, I need a bring new start
And even money can't find and sorry, can't give
I want a new life, I want to begin
Christmas, made my broken heart
