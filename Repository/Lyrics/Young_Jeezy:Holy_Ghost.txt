Holy Ghost 
Young Jeezy

[Verse 1:]
Whatâs in the back of my mind, sittinâ in the back of that thang
With the two double are sittinâ in the back of my brain
Anywhere but here, thatâs what I told my sofa
And this shit gettinâ heavy, weight of the world on my shoulders
Think you figured it out, but you donât have a clue
Think you on top of the world but the world on top of you
I started hustlinâ for draws and now thereâs plaques on the walls
Think Iâm sellinâ my soul? Then you can come get âem all
Trade âem all for my dawgs, yea, Iâm talkinâ to you
Where did we go wrong? Because I donât have a clue
You just wanna hit the mall and buy a new pair of shoes
But itâs real consequences nigga remember the rules
So I regret the day you ever serve that nigga
Took 5 years of your life, you didnât deserve that nigga
I guess power and pain look itâs somewhat the same
I lost my dawg to the fame, I charge it all to the game

[Hook:]
Please Lord forgive him, you know he got that thug in him
We lust for alcohol and we love women
And ainât nobody gave us nothinâ, so we drug dealinâ
You know we coppinâ Louie loafers just to thug in âem
And when you made it that far, you should be makinâ a toast
Got the seats reclined and I be doinâ the most
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost
In the back of this Holy Ghost

[Verse 2:]
I said we came so far but yet it feel so surreal
Hood nigga, half a mili, automobile
Iâm talkinâ real luxury, donât feel a bump in the road
We ainât like the rest of these niggas that fall out over hoes
Thought you my nigga forever, thought that you could be trusted
Man I found out you takinâ it, really had me disgusted
Nigga, who am I kiddinâ? It felt like a heart attack
Cause I gave you my heart and didnât ask for it back
And to be honest with you, I really thought we were brothers
Fuck everyone in this world as long as we have each other
Woulda done anyything, took a trafficking charge
Everyday on my head just to see you livinâ large
Gangster pitted it kills, gave you your first mill
And I ainât tell you to blow it, I ainât tell you to throw it
You fell a victim to pressure, yea, I know it can stress ya
But youâre only a man, homie, I canât be mad at ya

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
How can ya see out the windows between your shades and your tint
Sippinâ good in the back, Iâm like fuck it, Iâm bent
If it donât make dollars, then it donât make any sense
They sayinâ I owe âem dollars and that donât make any sense
Almost fell for the bait, almost fell for the hate
And Iâm the same nigga that let you niggas eat off my plate
Saw that shit from the door, knew that shit from the go
I guess this how I go, sit back and laugh at the show
Remember back in the day a nigga took your shit
Told you donât put it there and a nigga stole your brick
Didnât I put ya back on, did I handle ya wrong?
When niggas start actinâ weak that means it time to be strong
See I kept it so real, I ainât keep it real with myself
Iâm gone be real with you niggas, I gotta be real with myself
And Iâm gone be real with ya homie, look you donât got me convinced
Is this payback for my sins? I guess I gotta repent

[Hook:]
