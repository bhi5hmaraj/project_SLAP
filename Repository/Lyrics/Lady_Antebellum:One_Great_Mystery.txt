One Great Mystery 
Lady Antebellum

[Verse: Hillary Scott)
I don't know how many stars fill the sky
I know we're here, but I don't know why
Maybe there's some other life out there
But as long as you're here with me, baby, I don't really care

[Chorus:]
There is only one great mystery
I keep searching for the answer desperately
Tell me, tell me baby, tell me please
What did I ever do to make you fall for me?

[Verse 2: Charles Kelley)
Don't know what happens when we live this world
I know I'll go right on loving you girl
I'll close my eyes and drift off into the blue
And if I go first, I will wait for you

[Chorus:]
There is only one great mystery
I keep searching for the answer desperately
Tell me, tell me baby, tell me please
What did I ever do to make you fall for me?

[Bridge:]
I guess I'll never really know
How I deserve someone that loves me so

[Chorus:]
There is only one great mystery
I keep searching for the answer desperately
Tell me, tell me baby, tell me please
What did I ever do to make you fall for me?
