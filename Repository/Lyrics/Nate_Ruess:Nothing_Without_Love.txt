Nothing Without Love 
Nate Ruess

I am nothing without love
I'm but a ship stuck in the sand
Some would say that I'm all alone
But I am, I'm nothing without love

I wanna hold her in my arms
She feelin' alone, she feelin' sad
I would take credit for what's wrong,
But I am, I'm nothing without love

Three years at sea after the storm
And this sinking ship-love you put me on
God, I wish a gust of wind would come
And carry me home
But I, I got nowhere to go
Now I hear you sharp with the force of a wave
So I said myself I'm headed for the unpast day
Hey hey, I don't wanna lose this one
She made me feel whole, you know
I am, I'm nothing without love

Oh baby, show me a sign
Send me a signal that everything's fine
Come on, stand up right up by my side
You know that I wanna rest in your life

Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
I wanna rest in your life
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh

I am nothing without love
I'm just these palms without a pair
And I would take credit for this all
But I, I am nothing without love
Oh baby, show me a sign
Send me a signal that everything's fine
Come on, come one, come on right by my side
Don't you know that I, don't you know that I
Don't you know that I, I wanna rest in your life
I wanna rest in your life
I wanna rest in your life
I wanna rest in your life
'Cause I, I am nothing without love

Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
Na na na hey, ooh oh
