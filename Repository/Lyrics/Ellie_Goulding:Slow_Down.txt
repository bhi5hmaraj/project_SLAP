Slow Down 
Ellie Goulding

[Verse:]
Nothing changes
That's all I ever wanted
Wishing you were closer
But there is so much in between
This feels different
With you I've never been so sure
You reel me in
I'd never been that far before
That's what I found
That's what I found
That's what I found

[Chorus:]
These days slow down
Nothing but air and oceans between us
Weighing me down
I wish that we had nothing in common
Then there would be no distance to dwell on

[Verse 2:]
I am waiting but what good is another day
I've got too much time
But never time enough to say
You're all I wanted
You are all I wanted
You're all I found
You're what I found

[Chorus:]
These days slow down
Nothing but air and oceans between us
Weighing me down
I wish that we had nothing in common
Then there would be no distance to dwell on

[Verse 3:]
You give me all
The time that you have
But you're still away
In no way I'm glad
Cause I've got more time
So I can work out
All the places we'll go
And what we'll talk about
Oh when you're back

[Chorus:]
These days slow down
Nothing but air and oceans between us
Weighing me down
I wish that we had nothing in common
Then there would be no distance to dwell on

[Outro:]
I wish that we had nothing in common
Then there would be no distance to dwell onâ
