If Rain Is What You Want 
Slipknot

It's been years since anyone could be a friend
It's the fear that kept me fearing in the end
Can we face it? Can we shape it? Can we really die?
If rain is what you want, all you have to do is close your eyes
Just close your eyes

I am watching resurrections start to crawl
Is there any chance in hell? Any chance at all?
Do we need it? Do we see it? Is it really there?
If rain is what you want, then take your seats, enjoy the fall
Enjoy the fall

... Demon in my life
The only thing closer than my life
There's no black, there's not a, a comeback from my side
My sad eyes (will never sleep again)

In these diamonds, we left the color black
As pressure takes it's toll, we will outlast
For you can't break my heart
As long as I can be myself, I'll never fall apart
And you can't take me yet
If I'm not broken, break me down
So I will never feel alone again

... Demon in my life
The only thing closer than my life
There's no black, there's not a... From my side
My sad eyes (will never sleep again)
My sad eyes (will never sleep again)
My sad eyes (will never sleep again)
