How about this one.

Ya

Half alive and stark raving free
In the line front, encroaching
The purpose of this commercial-free interruption
Due to the prolific nature of this statement
Listener aggression is advised

It's strange, whenever I see a gun
I think about just how petty you are
And it blows my fucking mind
Yeah, it blows my fucking mind
These days, I never seem to get enough
I'm tired of this shit, I want to go up
Don't waste my fucking time
Don't waste my fucking time
Because anything exceptional
Gets crushed by governed people
With jealousy and ignorance
And all that coven equals
This one, it isn't special
Collections made of clay
I'm waiting for the punishment
I know it's on my way

Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up

Irreverence is my disease
It's secondhand, but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity

Somewhere on a toilet wall I read the words you form a line
To formalize, the former lies
And I finally saw the truth
Something so profound and it was sitting there
Surrounded by the garbage and the stains
Another victim of the refuse
Now I've been saying this for years
But you don't comprehend it
I fight hell and I fight fear
Because I understand it
Androgeny and insults
Your choice, don't wanna be difficult
You wanna win the war?
Know what you're fighting for

Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up

Irreverence is my disease
It's secondhand, but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity
With angel eyes and demon seeds
You're missing what you really need
When all is said and done, you see
The last man standing gets no pity
No pity, no pity, no pity
No pity, no pity
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and
Fuck, fuck, fuck me up
