What Happened To Your Band 
McBusted

Tonight, I feel like I just wanna let it go
And hang with a crowd that I don't even know
So I don't lose my mind
Back home, the words that I hear are so predictable
They fuck with my mind, make me miserable
They gotta know first hand
They wanna understand
What happened to your band?
What are your future plans?
I'm like your biggest fan
Where'd you go, I've been lost without you, it's crazy
Time moves slow, I ain't seen you on the TV lately
I walk through the neighbourhood where I used to live
And the only thing that people ask me is
What happened to your band?
What happened to your band?
What happened to your band?
What are your future plans?
I'm like your biggest fan
Where'd you go, I've been lost without you, it's crazy
Time moves slow, I ain't seen you on the TV lately
Where'd you go (go go go)?
Time moves slow (slow slow slow)
Where'd you go, I've been lost without you, it's crazy
Time moves slow, I ain't seen you on the TV lately
Where'd you go, I've been lost without you, it's crazy
Time moves slow, I ain't seen you on the TV lately
What happened to your band?
