Dead Inside 
Muse

Revere a million prayers
And draw me into your holiness
But there's nothing there
Light only shines from those who share
Unleash a million drones
And confine me then erase me babe
Do you have no soul?
It's like I died long ago
Your lips feel warm to the touch
You can bring me back to life
On the outside you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside

You're free to touch the sky
Whilst I am crushed and pulverised
Because you need control
Now I'm the one who's letting go
You like to give an inch
Whilst I am giving infinty
But now I've got nothing left
You have no cares and I'm bereft
Your skin feels warm to caress
I see magic in your eyes
On the outside you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside

Feel me now
Hold me please
I need you to see who I am
Open up to me
Stop hiding from me
It's hurting me
Only you can stop the pain
Don't leave me out in the cold
Don't leave me out to die
I gave you everything
I can't give you any more
Now I've become just like you
My lips feel warm to the touch
But my words seem so alive
My skin warm to caress
I'll control and hypnotize
You've taught me to lie without a trace
And to kill with no remorse
On the outside I'm the greatest guy
Now I'm dead inside
