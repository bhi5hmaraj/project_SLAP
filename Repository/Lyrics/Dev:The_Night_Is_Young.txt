The Night Is Young 
Dev

[Intro]
I turn it up, I, I, I turn it up
Turn it up, I turn it up, turn it up,
I turn it up, turn it up, I turn it up
Turn it, turn it, turn it up

[Verse 1]
The sky is purple
I'm running on turbo
I got 20 fake bitches
That I draw in a circle
And stay away from
I'm gonna get my bacon
In the rich sense
Not the pig sense
My flow exotic incense
Intense
I'm doin 90 on the freeway
Hear me on the radio
All they do is replay
I used to turn it off
Now I turn it up
They call me Dev

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn it up, I, I, I turn it up
I turn it up, I, I, I turn it up
Turn it up, I turn it up, turn it up,
I turn it up, turn it up, I turn it up
Turn it, turn it, turn it up

[Chorus]
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead (come here baby)
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead (come here baby)
The night, the night is young

[Verse 2]
I see you chewing on your upper lip
Brain fried
Come and take a ride on the mother-ship
Do you know who you fuckin with
We the deans list
Queen bitch
Leave your king speechless
Spitting your weakness
It ain't the same
Wanna piece of my peach
Press press play
So here we go
Spending winters on the beaches
Wide awake
Even when we sleepin

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn it up, I, I, I turn it up
I turn it up, I, I, I turn it up
Turn it up, I turn it up, turn it up,
I turn it up, turn it up, I turn it up
Turn it, turn it, turn it up

[Chorus]
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead (come here baby)
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead (come here baby)
The night, the night is young

[Pre-Chorus]
I turn it up, I, I, I turn it up
I turn it up, I, I, I turn it up
Turn it up, I turn it up, turn it up,
I turn it up, turn it up, I turn it up
Turn it, turn it, turn it up

[Chorus]
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead (come here baby)
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead
The night, the night is young
The day is dead (come here baby)
The night, the night is young
