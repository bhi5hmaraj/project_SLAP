Fire 
Gavin Degraw

Oh, if there's one thing to be told
It's dreams are made to be caught
And friends can never be bought

Doesn't matter how long it's been
I know you'll always jump in
Cause we don't know how to quit

Let's start a riot tonight
A pack of lions tonight
In this world he who stops
Won't get anything he wants

Play like the top one percent
âtil nothing is left to spend
Take it all, ours to take
Celebrate because

We are the champions
Setting it off again
Oh, we're on fire
We're on fire

Running our own campaign
Doing the whole shebang
Oh we're on fire
We're on fire

Get up, stand up
Throw your hands up
Welcome to the other land of
Dreamers, brothers, sisters, others
Yeah, we're on fire like that

Oh, the bond is deeper than skin
The kind of club that we're in
The kind of love that we give

Oh, ever since the dawn of mankind
We all belong to a tribe
It's good to know this one's mine

Let's start a riot tonight
A pack of lions tonight
In this world he who stops
Won't get anything he wants

Play like the top one percent
âtil nothing is left to be spent
We don't care, we won't stop
Call your mothers, call the cops

We are the champions
Setting it off again
Oh, we're on fire
We're on fire

Running our own campaign
Doing the whole shebang
Oh we're on fire
We're on fire

Get up, stand up
Throw your hands up
Welcome to the other land of
Dreamers, brothers, sisters, others
Yeah, we're on fire like that

Fire, fire, fire, fire
And nothing's gonna be the same
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Oh!

We are the champions
Setting it off again
Oh, we're on fire
We're on fire

Running our own campaign
Doing the whole shebang
Oh we're on fire
We're on fire

Nothing's gonna be the same
Fire, fire, fire, fire
