Mascara 
Jazmine Sullivan

[Verse 1]
Yeah my hair and my ass fake, but so what?
I get my rent paid with it and my tits get me trips
To places I can't pronounce right
He said he'd keep it coming if I keep my body tight
And them bitches stay mad cause I'm living the life
âCause I'm living the life, oh
Most people think I'm shallow
âCause I'm always dressed like I'm going out to the club
But I gotta keep up cause it's new chicks poppin' up everyday
And they want the same thang

[Hook]
So I never leave the house without makeup on
I keep mascara in my pocket if I'm running to the market
âCause you never know who's watching you
So I got to stay on, (I-I)I got to stay on
I got to stay on, I got to stay on
Said I got to stay on!

[Verse 2]
No, I ain't got a job, but so what?
I don't need it when I'm getting everything that I want
And everything that I ask for
I wear that freakum dress for daddy and he give me more
And them bitches stay mad cause they working so hard
While I'm working so smart, oh
It's a small price to pay when you're living this good
And it keep me in the heels, and it kept me out the hood
âCause it's new chicks poppin' up everyday
And they want the same thang

[Hook]
So I never leave the house without the make-up on
I keep mascara in my pocket if I'm running to the market
âCause you never know who's watching you
So I got to stay on, (I-I)I got to stay on
I got to stay on, I got to stay on
Said I got to stay on!

[Verse 3]
Now, I know why you're looking at me like that
It ain't attractive when you're looking at me like that
No, don't be mad cause while you're cooking
Dinner for your broke nigga
You could be in the gym working on your figure like me
So, don't I deserve to be privileged?
Don't I deserve to get the very best?
âCause it ain't easy being this fine all the time
âCause if it was, then we all could do it
But we can't, no no
So bitch don't kill my vibe, don't be mad cause you coach class
And I'm in that G-5
Beautiful girls run the whole world
That's why I got to stay on!

[Hook]
So I never leave the house without makeup on
I keep mascara in my pocket if I'm running to the market
âCause you never know who's watching you
So I got to stay on, (I-I)I got to stay on
I got to stay on, I got to stay on
Said I got to stay on!

[Outro]
Oh oh
Yeah, she drive the dope boys crazy
She knows, all them hoes so jealous
Cause that ass, will make a man leave home, uh
That's why she keeps her mascara on, uuh uuu
