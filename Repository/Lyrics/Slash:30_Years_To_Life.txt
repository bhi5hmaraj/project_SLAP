30 Years To Life 
Slash

So the story goes
This is a tale that must be told
For what could be your destiny youâll never know

I never meant to be here
I never even tried
But I tell you now when youâre lost and downed
You come to trouble in time
It was a cold December
A wet city night
In a steel toe rage made a big mistake
Now Iâll be doing time

I was running with the order
I was running out of time
Now for me there is no quarter
I donât wanna be here
I donât wanna die

Serving 30 years to life
What I did I canât deny
Now the sorrow in my heart will never fade
I remember it so well
The night I sent that boy to hell
Lord Iâm sorry for the error of my ways

They sent me on a mission
Out to earn my stripes
Should've known damn well when the curbstone fell
Things would never be right

I was running with the order
I was running out of time
Now for me there is no quarter
I donât wanna be here
How many nights Iâve cried

Serving 30 years to life
What I did I canât deny
Now the sorrow in my heart will never fade
I remember it so well
The night I sent that boy to hell
Lord Iâm sorry for the error of my ways

'cause now I know, now I know
I was wrong and I canât let this go
I know, now I know
I am sorry, what a wretched soul
Oh, what a big mistake

(Solo)

Now Iâm growing old
18 years or more to go
I waste away in this cage, Iâm all alone
Thatâs how the story goes, this is a tale that must be told
For what could be your destiny, youâll never know

'cause when youâre running with the order
Youâre only running out of time
Now for me there is no quarter
I didnât wanna be here
I donât wanna die

Serving 30 years to life
What I did I canât deny
Now the sorrow in my heart will never fade
Know it well, I know it well
But itâs too late to save myself
Lord Iâm sorry for the error of my ways

So the story goes, this is a tale that must be told
The sorrow in my heart will never fade
So the story goes, this is a tale that must be told
Yes, Iâm sorry for the error of my ways
