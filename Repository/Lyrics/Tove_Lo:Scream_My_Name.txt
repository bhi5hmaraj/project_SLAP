Scream My Name 
Tove Lo

[Verse 1]
Fist fights, long nights, come home late
Can't sleep, I keep me awake
Flip through the lives on TV
I'll say, for now, I'm happy

[Pre-Chorus]
Love it when I'm play-pretending
When I can take bullets to the heart
Fuckin' up my happy ending
But I can take bullets to the heart

[Chorus]
Breathing violence and love, I was born on the scene
Now it runs in my blood, yeah, you know what I mean
When I'm dead and gone, will they sing about me?
Dead and gone, will they scream my name?
Scream my name

[Verse 2]
Wake up, guard up, and I'm bored
Night runs with guns, too hardcore
Don't dare to care about someone
I'm dirt, I'm ice, is that wrong?

[Pre-Chorus]
Love it when I'm play-pretending
When I can take bullets to the heart
Fuckin' up my happy ending
But I can take bullets to the heart

[Chorus]
Breathing violence and love, I was born on the scene
Now it runs in my blood, yeah, you know what I mean
When I'm dead and gone, will they sing about me?
Dead and gone, will they scream my name?
Scream my name

[Breakdown]
Ah-ah
Ohh...

[Chorus 2x]
Breathing violence and love, I was born on the scene
Now it runs in my blood, yeah, you know what I mean
When I'm dead and gone, will they sing about me?
Dead and gone, will they scream my name?
Scream my name
