Too Young To Remember 
Florrie

I'm too young to remember
I wanna get, wanna get what I want
Hey!
I'm too young to remember
I wanna get, wanna get what I want
Hey!

Feeling too young to run
Feeling too young to care about what happened
Too young to run
Now I'm through all away
All I want is some fun...
