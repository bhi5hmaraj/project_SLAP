Heroes 
Alesso

[Verse 1: Tove Lo]
We go hideaway in daylight
We go undercover when under sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty
That's where we run

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be

[Verse 2: Tove Lo]
Anybody's got the power
They don't see it
âCos they don't understand
Spin around and run for hours
You and me we got the world in our hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can't be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything

[Chorus]
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be

[Refrain: Tove Lo]
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you...
We could be

[Bridge: Tove Lo]
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light
(We could be)
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light

[Refrain: Tove Lo]
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you...
We could be
