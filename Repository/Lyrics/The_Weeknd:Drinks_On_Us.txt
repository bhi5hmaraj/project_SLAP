Drinks On Us 
The Weeknd

[Intro: The Weeknd]
You know I been on now, then, and I'm next
Every year my year, you know I always wanna flex
Got a couple villains who can't make it out the set
I'll probably sneak a couple on this motherfuckin' jet

[Hook: The Weeknd]
If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us
If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us
If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us
If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Bet you never seen my niggas pull up to the spot
I just signed so many checks my wrist about to pop
If you ever talk about me when I'm not around
Your girl'll probably tell me when I put it in her mouth
Put your wallet in your pocket, bitch you playing
Even when I wasn't on, I'm always paying
Went from hipsters, now it's models and these singers
And my hair be growing like a fuckin' Saiyan
I popped a couple pills, I think that I'm Devante
I fuck a bitch from Lost and Found like every Monday
My jaw line so defined, I'm wildin' like I'm Gunplay
You see no white inside my eyes and it's a fun day
But when I'm workin', girl, I'm workin' for the millions
Girl, when I'm workin', I be workin' for them billions
Why your hair down, I ain't trickin', find another sucka
These bitches tryna make a living, but

[Hook: The Weeknd]
If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us
If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us
If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us
If you wanna go to the bar, drinks on us

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
If ya'll wanna hang out with the gangstas, ya'll go 'head
I'm just gonna count a little motherfuckin' bread
If ya'll wanna slither with the snakes, then ya'll go 'head
I keep a pedicured lawn so them snakes, they will be dead
Tears of joy run down my cheek onto the soil
I would trick off on your bitch, but she ain't loyal
Nothing but love for you niggas riding with no tint
Grand total, five digits, make those hoes repent
Popped a couple pills, I feel like Johnny Mad Dog
I lost a couple friends, I'm tryna get these bands dog
You know we in this bitch, we throwin' up them grands, ya'll
And once we get that club, we 'bout fun, go ham ya'll
My comrades want them mills, my comrades want them millions
My comrades want them bills, my comrades want them billions
My comrades want that tri, my comrades want them trillions
Yeah, we need more than racks, my comrades want them illions

[Pre-Hook: Swae Lee]
Been provin', you ain't ever goin' up
Every time you hit the club, you always fuck it up

[Hook: Swae Lee]
If y'all wanna go to the bar, drinks on us (turn up)
If y'all wanna go to the bar, drinks on us (on us)
If y'all wanna go to the bar, drinks on us (said turn up)
If y'all wanna go to the bar, drinks on us (baka baka bah bah)

[Verse 3: Future]
Say my, say my, say my name
Switchin' bitches and I'm switchin' lanes
When they call last shot for alcohol, I just wanna take my last drink
I just wanna sip some clean purple
Hit the car lot and just made a purchase
I just realized that I am a star, cruisin' my coupe up the boulevard
None of my pictures are watermarked
Got more water than a waterbar
Evian draped me up, nigga
Yellow bones suck my nuts, nigga
She think it's chocolate but she call me Papi
Papi Chulo, I'ma get it poppin'
Got some red bottoms on a hottie thottie
Put them heels from her nipples, a new karate
I just came in like a kamikaze
I just walk 'round like a zombie, daddy
I don't like bein' in paddy wagons
So no remorse, I'm about the fetti
Had a few horses come by the telly
Eating each other, they get some credit
Got commas on commas, I'm really ready
I'm really 'bout to pour up on a jet
I would never mention niggas names
Tell a nigga, a nigga never did exist
You niggas never ever been a threat
These niggas never get enough attention
I just put the bitch on punishment
I've been hangin' where the money been
I don't know what type of love is this
Can you tell me where my dogs at?
Put a hollow in your ball cap
What type of nigga you call that?
When I hang up on you, never call back
I'm a money counter, count my own money

[Pre-Hook: Swae Lee]
Been provin', you ain't ever goin' up
Every time you hit the club, you always fuck it up

[Hook: Swae Lee]
If y'all wanna go to the bar, drinks on us (turn up)
If y'all wanna go to the bar, drinks on us (on us)
If y'all wanna go to the bar, drinks on us (said turn up)
If y'all wanna go to the bar, drinks on us (baka baka bah bah)

[Outro: Swae Lee]
If ya'll wanna hang out with the gangsters, ya'll go head
I'm just gonna count a little motherfucking bread
If ya'll wanna slither with the snakes, then ya'll go head
I keep a pedicured lawn so them snakes, they will be dead
