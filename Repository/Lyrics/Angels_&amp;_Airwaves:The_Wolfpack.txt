The Wolfpack 
Angels &amp; Airwaves

[Verse:]
No bother, climb to it and call out canary
Don't worry, just grab it, it's something - abuse it
My vision, a forest, a lot here to carry
Slide over and bite it, the apple and berry
The volume and the riot
The smell of the lions
The sunset behind me
The bullets start flying

[Pre-Chorus:]
Finding a light in a world of ruin
Starting to dance when the earth is caving in
We're ready to begin

[Chorus:]
It's alright, a bit scathed, a bit lost
I've been played, I ain't that clever
A city boy that can never say never
I got the life but that girl bites like a wolf

[Verse 2:]
Inertia, take cover, a cannon, you ready?
My image, the session, a poet is sleeping
The courier, the pilot, antennas, and sirens
That college, like thieves that can eat with the wolfpack

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Finding a light in a world of ruin (world of ruin)
Starting to dance when the earth is caving in
Setting the sun and our hearts are burning (hearts are burning)
Leaving the nest to the back of a thousand winds
We're ready to begin

[Chorus 2:]
It's alright, a bit scathed, a bit lost
I've been played, I ain't that clever
A city boy that can never say never
I got the life but that girl bites like
It's on me, it's only a small heart on one sleeve
Academy killer
Off with his head in the make believe game of fools
That girl bites like a wolf

[Bridge:]
Are you, are you ready? I'm waiting to begin
Are you, are you ready? I'm waiting to begin

[Chorus 2:]
It's alright, a bit scathed, a bit lost
I've been played, I ain't that clever
A city boy that can never say never
I got the life but that girl bites like
It's on me, it's only a small heart on one sleeve
Academy killer
Off with his head in the make believe game of fools
That girl bites like a wolf

[Chorus 2:]
It's alright, a bit scathed, a bit lost
I've been played, I ain't that clever
A city boy that can never say never
I got the life but that girl bites like
It's on me, it's only a small heart on one sleeve
Academy killer
Off with his head in the make believe game of fools
That girl bites like a wolf
