It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas 
Union J

[Josh]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the Five and Ten
Glistening once again
Candy canes and silver lanes aglow

[George]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store

[JJ]
But the prettiest sight to see
Is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Jaymi]
A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

[George]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas

[All]
Everywhere you go

[Josh]
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[All]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start

[Josh]
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart

[Jaymi]
A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

[All]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start

[Josh]
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing

[Josh does the melody with harmonies of Jaymi]
Right within your heart
