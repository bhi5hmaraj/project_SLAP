Just A Girl 
Lady Antebellum

[Verse:]
Boy, you must have come up short tonight
Cuz I'm always your consolation prize
Usually I fix my hair, but oh
My coat is sure about your door(?)
But no more!

[Chorus:]
Now I know I'm just another one of your Friday nights
But I'm no pass time, this is gonna be the last
I'm just a call when there's nowhere else to call
Just a number on your wall, and a dress and curves
To you I'm just a girl, to you I'm just a girl

[Verse 2:]
I was always taught to sit up straight
Find a man before it gets too late
Give him time to make his mind
But I can't be the one you stream along
Like some old sad song

[Chorus:]
Now I know I'm just another one of your Friday nights
But I'm no pass time, this is gonna be the last
I'm just a call when there's nowhere else to call
Just a number on your wall, and a dress and curves
To you I'm just a girl, to you I'm just a girl

[Bridge:]
Talking through the static just to?
To you I'm just dramatic, just a girl
Just a silly lil thing
That's all you've ever seen
When there's so much more to me
Yeah, ah-ah, yeah, ah-ah

[Instrumental]

[Bridge:]
Now I know I'm just another one of your Friday nights
But I'm no pass time, this is gonna be the last

[Chorus:]
Now I know I'm just another one of your Friday nights
But I'm no pass time, this is gonna be the last
I'm just a call when there's nowhere else to call
Just a number on your wall, and a dress and curves
To you I'm just a girl, to you I'm just a girl
