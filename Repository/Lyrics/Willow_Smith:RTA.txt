If you really wanna go to London, boy
I'll sail ya, I'll sail ya
If you wanna see a blackhole, singularity

If you're interested in being free
If you really wanna go to London, boy

I'll sail ya, I'll sail ya
If you wanna see a blackhole, singularity
Holla back at me
If you're interested in being free
