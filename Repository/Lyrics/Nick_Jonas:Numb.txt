Numb 
Nick Jonas

This is so dumb, this is so bad
Ought to be numb to wish you like that
Lifting me up, letting me fall
Fuck with my head like there's nothing there at all

You were my sun, you were my
I was your past and you were mine fast
Breaking my heart one push at a time
There's a reason why, yeah

You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you stole my heart
And all I have is a hole where it used to be
And my heart is flawed

It's like you've got some substitute for me
But he's not the one
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you leave me numb

Yeah, you leave me numb, numb

Losing my mind, losing control
Swallow my pride, you swallow me whole
Smile on my face to cover my hurt
Spent so much time but what was that for?

I'm broken hard, I'm saving it all
Crossing my head, mistaken for love
Marks on my back, they don't mean a thing
They ain't yours, they ain't yours

You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you stole my heart
And all I have is a hole where it used to be
And my heart is flawed

It's like you've got some substitute for me
But he's not the one
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you leave me numb

Numb, yeah you leave me

I got dropped off in a black box
Lived on a matchbox in your rage
You say "we are merely players
Who still act off at this day
I kept begging you to stay like
"Baby, please don't leave me"
And I dream on, you gettin' your plot and your scheme on
And I behave where my beans on
He love me, he love me, no he don't
'Cause you make me feel like the night before Christmas
Love is a crime, and I'm stuck in your prision
Far as you want, baby I go the distance
If you on it, I'm on it, why are we drilling

You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you stole my heart
And all I have is a hole where it used to be
And my heart is flawed

It's like you've got some substitute for me
But he's not the one
You don't know what it is you do to me
Yeah, you leave me numb
