Blame 
Calvin Harris

[Verse 1]
Can't be sleeping
Keep on waking
Without the woman next to me
Guilt is burning
Inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can keep

[Chorus x4]
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Don't blame it on me

[Verse 2]
Can't you see it
I was manipulated
I had to let her through the door
I had no choice in this
I was the friend she missed
She needed me to talk

[Chorus x4]
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me


Don't blame it on me

[Bridge]
Oh I'm so sorry, so sorry baby
I'll be better this time
I will be better this time

I got to say
I'm so sorry

Oh I Promise
I'll be better this time

Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
