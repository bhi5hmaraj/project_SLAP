Weeds 
Marina And The Diamonds

[Verse 1]
Could have filled a garden
With all the flowers that you gave me, baby
But none of them were ours
You know the problem with history
It keeps coming back like a weed
And when nothing feels enough
At least you taught me how to love
But he keeps growing back

[Chorus]
Like weeds
Baby, just open your eyes to see
He's growing from inside me
And I just don't know what I can do
I thought I cut him at the root
Like weeds
Like weeds

[Verse 2]
I miss all of my exes
They're the only ones that know me
And God knows that sex is
A way to feel a bit, a little bit less lonely
Yeah, I tried to keep it covered up
Yeah, I thought I cut him at the root
But now I think my time is up
Cause he keeps growing back

[Chorus]
Like weeds
Baby, just open your eyes to see
He's growing from inside me
And I just don't know what I can do
I thought I cut him at the root
Like weeds
Like weeds
Like weeds
Yeah

[Bridge]
Baby

[Chorus]:
Like weeds
Like weeds
Like weeds
Yeah, yeah
Baby, just open your eyes to see
He's growing from inside me
And I just don't know what I can do
I thought I cut him at the root
Like weeds
Like weeds
