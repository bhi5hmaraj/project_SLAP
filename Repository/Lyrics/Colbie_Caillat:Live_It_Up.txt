Live It Up 
Colbie Caillat

Live it up up up
Live it up up up
Live it up up up

A thousand people stood in line
To hear a couple words of mine
Afraid I would miss a beat
And everyone is watching me
I don't know why I'm still afraid
It's not like it was yesterday
I'm the one stopping me
From all the I want to be

It's ridiculous
The stars are inconspicuous
I told myself this can't be how I think
It's irrational
It seems so supernatural
I'm happy every after all I've seen

I'm unstoppable
I drop kick impossible
I Live it up up up
Live it up up up
I break down the walls
I back up, smashing ball
I Live it up up up
Live it up up up
Ooh ooh
Live it up up up
Ooh ooh
Live it up up up

Don't know why my stomach drops
Like jumping off my old town
I used to be fearless when I had my safety ness
Wake up my heart is beating fast
Cause I ain't got no strings attached
Afraid of go anywhere, everywhere
It's just that I don't know

It's ridiculous
The stars are inconspicuous
I told myself this can't be how I think
It's irrational
It seems so supernatural
I'm happy every after all I've seen

I'm unstoppable
I drop kick impossible
I Live it up up up
Live it up up up
I break down the walls
I back up, smashing ball
I Live it up up up
Live it up up up
Ooh ooh
Live it up up up
Ooh ooh
Live it up up up

You know I'm not afraid
You know I'm not afraid
I Live it up up up
Ooh no I'm not afraid
Nooo, yeah, yeah

I'm unstoppable
I drop kick impossible
I Live it up up up
Live it up up up
I break down the walls
I back up, smashing ball
I Live it up up up
Live it up up up
Ooh ooh
Live it up up up
Ooh ooh
Live it up up up
