What Goes Around Comes Around 
Justin Timberlake

Hey, girl
Is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand

So, why the love went away?
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong

Don't wanna think about it (uh)
Don't wanna talk about it (uh)
I'm just so sick about it
I can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it (uh)
Feeling the blues about it (yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's ok, baby
'Cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Yeah

Now, girl
I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now (on now)
Maybe I should do the same (maybe I should do the same)
The funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you baby (baby)
And now, it's all just a shame
That I guess I was wrong

Don't wanna think about it (no)
Don't wanna talk about it (hum)
I'm just so sick about it
I can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it (uh)
Feeling the blues about it (yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Can you tell me is this fair

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's ok, baby
'Cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Yeah

What goes around, comes around
Yeahhh
What goes around, comes around
You should know that
What goes around, comes around
Yeahhh
What goes around, comes around
You should know that

Don't wanna think about it (no)
Don't wanna talk about it (hm)
I'm just so sick about it
I can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it (uh)
Feeling the blues about it (yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
(Shoulda known better)
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
(Now it's breaking my heart)
Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's ok, baby,
'Cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
(What goes around comes around, baby)
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
(What goes around comes around, baby)
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Yeah

Yup, yup
Yup
(Let me paint this picture for you, baby)
Yup

You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And everytime you call him,
All you get a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes
When you cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So keep going without saying
That ya left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case a scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl, you got what you deserved
And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right
But girl, I ain't somebody
I'm out of sympathy
See...

What goes around comes back around
I thought I told ya, hey
What goes around comes back around
I thought I told ya, hey
What goes around comes back around
I thought I told ya, hey
What goes around comes back around
I thought I told ya, hey

Take it to 'em, J

Hey

Haha
See, you shoulda listened to me, baby
Take it to 'em, J
Because "What goes around comes back around"
Hahahaha
Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
