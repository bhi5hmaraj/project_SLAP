Not Your Man 
Professor Green

I gave you my everything,
Guess that didn't mean anything to you
'Cause I'm not your man
All the nights I spent with you not making love, just making do
Ooh, I'm not your man

I'm swimming way out of my depth
I'm in way over my head
I wish she never showed me her bed, bed, bed
I wish I could forget

What you take me for?
What you take me for?
Gave you everything
Yet you're still looking at me like
I could've gave you more, gave you more?
I ain't got anything left to give, somebody better know if I'm the next of kin
'Cause the stress is killing me, either you're feeling me or not
Either way I ain't gonna be spending any more money on Tiffany
I'm done with that, what do you think I rap for?
To buy you a bag? Are you mad?
I'm a catch, the type of man women normally go mad for
Sick of love, sick of you, wish I was but I ain't though
Changed like a boy in trance, anything that you ask for
I can't say no, don't give but you take loads
The dinners and taxis, I ain't ever been attracted to anybody as much
I am in love with you so madly, ain't ever treated you badly
But no matter what I do, you're unhappy
Is it cause my dick isn't as big as Dappy's

I'm swimming way out of my depth
I'm in way over my head
I wish she never showed me her bed, bed, bed
I wish I could forget

Playing a game that I'm losin' so I guess you're winnin'
I should've known better in the beginning
When you said you were a fan of BeyoncÃ©
But the only song you didn't like was "Independent Women"
"Bills, Bills, Bills", bet you liked that though
Dough with a D, yeah you like that doe
Gave you a key to the crib only to find
Your you when I came home
A temptress, a seductress
Who possessed enough perzazz to make me obsessed
When you undress you wanna compete, sorry I didn't know
It was a contest, but guess I won
'Cause I came first, is that the reason that you're upset?
Why would you keep coming back if it's just s** if it ain't no good?
Or is it the rest that you're interested in?
All of the spending in the restaurants
I gave you everything that you ever wanted and what did I get in return for it?
Louboutin, Louis Vuitton, your shoes cost more than
I used to earn in a month back when I used to sleep on a futon

I'm swimming way out of my depth
I'm in way over my head
I wish she never showed me her bed, bed, bed
I wish I could forget

I wish I could forget
Wish I could forget
I remember everything
I gave you my everything,
Guess that didn't mean anything to you...
