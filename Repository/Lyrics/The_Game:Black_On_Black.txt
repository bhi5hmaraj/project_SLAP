Black On Black 
The Game

Whassup ****a?
You know what this **** is
Street ****as, street ****as alive

Everything wrong just can't be right
Bangin' so much this can't be life
**** Get real may ko back
If you came back in that black on black
I still do it for the ****a with the bricks on bridge
I still do it for the ****a with the mix so mix
Let me tell how real ****a is ball all back
Say I can't let it back, I love all that

****A come do from nine and I half
I'mma tell them ain't anything left
****A need a half tell âem everything straight
Only gotta do is wait, tell the ****a I'm a chef
How you think the ****a wouldn't got that rave
Could I be your chef but I ball that case
Know you can't do tell them you miss on that time
Jim carry to the will had to switch this
Switch and get all to my daughter
He deserve everything so I got out of buket
Do anything for my destiny safe
She will be all safe and I'mma be her toy lucky
Black on black check a boy loyal luggage
On a pj feelin' like I'm bluffin'
With the? Or the twins ain't no carry buggin'
Get the shade the sheave clap, tellin' her that I love her
Back from all, finely
My grandmother say I never see it
She wanna come home on Thanksgiving
Put some black on black like here
Black on black to my dear
Black on black in my ear
Black Maserati when I gave to my mamma
Right here to the fall she don't even hear

Everything wrong just can't be right
Bangin' so much this can't be life
**** Get real may ko back
If you came back in that black on black
I still do it for the ****a with the bricks on bridge
I still do it for the ****a with the mix so mix
Let me tell how real ****a is ball all back
Say I can't let it back, I love all that

Hol up, hol up, hol up
She get real and we ain't fall up
That's how I call myself when my grandmother kiss me
****A tale, ****a try to blow up
This one sound more like my vibe
Same time have me for a couple dollars
Yeah I'm âbout up and now âbout to kill ****as
So you might not see me to the mall
Dude, I punch and start inching
So I hit the block and the I got missin'
See I'm bout to take a trip outside the town
And go find me trigger
Yeah I gotta make this ball, want it now, right now
Sorrowed and selling pictures
My friends told me let the money and rude it
Say it is then I rule all in
If I had to be presise, saying to danse on our life
****As win ery day, ****as fill ery night
I say not only Oprah got big?
Time to say, I tell myself
I'm staring in the mirror

Everything wrong just can't be right
Bangin' so much this can't be life
**** Get real may ko back
If you came back in that black on black
I still do it for the ****a with the bricks on bridge
I still do it for the ****a with the mix so mix
Let me tell how real ****a is ball all back
Say I can't let it back, I love all that

Man named Joe drive streets with no weapon
I let your calls and everything balls on the fridge
Stay bang in the pimp, house mella like picker
Street show no business, they are getting' to the business
Take up in the sea, ? Braking down to the ****as
Blew the money on the bill
We float by bells from the third set flipper
I don't ****a know a ****a livin' how I am livin'
I don't even know I'm on the travel to the prison
She get gangster and we call our beat
Ball two things with the? In the keisa
Two with two that's a scared with a nina
Eighty grans, fly two hundred and grans
Had extra ground when you are with the bake
Real try tap can't believe you
When you've out of line well dog I believe you
Keeps all the water for they kick a ****a dog
I'mma told âem but the flow just go
Dear game from tha canion
Everybody scarmbel but I ain't never panic
Double homicide per a day, that's my jacket
Try to burn some feet, cut all I'm a jacket
And I take change, I'mma serve that's a?
Couple out of town, I'mma text no relating

Everything wrong just can't be right
Bangin' so much this can't be life
**** Get real may ko back
If you came back in that black on black
I still do it for the ****a with the bricks on bridge
I still do it for the ****a with the mix so mix
Let me tell how real ****a is ball all back
