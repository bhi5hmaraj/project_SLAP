You Ruin Me 
The Veronicas

[Verse 1]
Job well done
Standing ovation
Yea you got what you wanted
I guess you've won
And I don't want to hear
"They don't know you like I do"
Even I could've told you
But now we're done

[Chorus]
Cause you play me like a symphony
Play me 'till your fingers bleed
I'm your greatest masterpiece
You ruin me
Later when the curtains drawn
And no one's there for you back home
Don't cry to me you played me wrong
You ruin me

[Verse 2]
I know you've thought that I wouldn't notice
You were acting so strange
I'm not that dumb
In the end, I hope she was worth it
I don't care if you love me
You make me numb

[Chorus]
Cause you play me like a symphony
Play me 'till your fingers bleed
I'm your greatest masterpiece
You ruin me
Later when the curtains drawn
And no one's there for you back home
Don't cry to me you played me wrong
You ruin me

[Bridge]
We're that song you wouldn't sing
Just a broken melody
You're killing me

[Chorus]
Cause you play me like a symphony
Play me 'till your fingers bleed
I'm your greatest masterpiece
You ruin me
Later when the curtains drawn
And no one's there for you back home
Don't cry to me you played me wrong
You ruin me
