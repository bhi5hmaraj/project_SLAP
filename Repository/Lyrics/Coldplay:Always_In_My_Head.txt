Always In My Head 
Coldplay

I think of you
I haven't slept
I think I do, but
I don't forget

My body moves
Goes where I will
But though I try my heart stays still
It never moves, just won't be led
And so my mouth waters to be fed

And you're always in my head
You're always in my head
You're always in my head
Always in my head

You're always in my head
Always in my...
You're always in my...

This I guess is to tell you
You're chosen out from the rest
