In The Heat Of The Moment 
Noel Gallagher

[Verse 1]
It's something in the way, she move too distraction
I travel all this way to try and make away
Cuz heavy in the air with the words that she left hanging
I try to walk away but I only stand and stare

[Hook]
The rain that comes and all the love that is left behind is gone
When the big man run got me the girl how electrfy the sky
And in a little while she begun
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I waited in the rain and my feet to wet to stand here
I showt out your name behind the rainbow raise
But so in the crowd she heard the change will changling
Like a memory of faiths she sleept away forget

[Hook]
The rain that comes and all the love that is left behind is gone
When the big man run got me the girl how electrfy the sky
When the big man run got me the girl how electrfy the sky
And in a little while she begun
Yeah, yeah
