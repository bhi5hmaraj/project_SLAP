Burning Gold 
Christina Perri

Looking for an exit in this world of fear
I can see the pack that leads the way
Mama never left, and daddy needs me here
I wish the wind would carry a change
Looking through the window to a world of dreams
I can see my future slip away
Honey you wonât get there if you donât believe
I wish the wind would carry a change

I've had enough
Iâm standing up
I need, I need a change
I've had enough of chasing luck
I need, I need a change

Iâm setting fire to the life that I know
We start a fire everywhere that we go
We starting fires, we starting fires
Till our lives are burning gold
Till our lives are burning gold


Looking for my ticket to a higher place
I can see my chance begin to fade
One step forward and two back again
I wish the wind would carry a change

I've had enough
Iâm standing up
I need, I need a change
I've had enough of chasing luck
I need, I need a change

Iâm setting fire to the life that I know
We start a fire everywhere that we go
We starting fires, we starting fires
Till our lives are burning gold
Till our lives are burning gold

Looking back I see I had the flame in me
Iâm the wind thatâs carrying a change

I've had enough of chasing luck
I need, I need a change

Iâm setting fire to the life that I know
We start a fire everywhere that we go
We starting fires, we starting fires
Till our lives are burning gold
Till our lives are burning gold

Iâm setting fire to the life that I know
We start a fire everywhere that we go
We starting fires, we starting fires
Till our lives are burning gold
Till our lives are burning gold
