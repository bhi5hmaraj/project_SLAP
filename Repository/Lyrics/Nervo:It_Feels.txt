It Feels 
Nervo

World moves quickly
When you're with me
Hearts give lasting
Once we started

Nothing's gonna change the way
That it feels 'cause I'm falling in love again
Nothing's gonna change the way
That it feels

Said nothing's gonna change the way
That it feels 'cause I'm falling in love again
Nothing's gonna change the way
That it feels

Stars come closer
Winter leaves us
Spring time greets us

Nothing's gonna change the way
That it feels 'cause I'm falling in love again
Nothing's gonna change the way
That it feels

Said nothing's gonna change the way
That it feels 'cause I'm falling in love again
Nothing's gonna change the way
That it feels

'Cause it feels good, it feels good
So tell me it is real, it is real, when we go
'Cause nothing it's as real, when I'm with you
So tell me it is real, it is real, when we go
