Don't Look Down 
Martin Garrix

Is your head spinning?
Is your heart racing?
Is the fire in your veins?
Are your bones burning?
Is your skin yearning?
'Cause you're driving me insane
I kinda feel like I feel like a summer light
You got me waiting up a thousand miles
Can we stay right here in the sand
Must feel like we're flying out in space

Don't look down
Off this high will never hit the ground
Don't look down
See that the sky we're gonna reach it now
Do you feel the lightning inside of you
Will you follow through if I fall for you
Don't look down
Off this high will never hit the ground

[Beat break]

Are your hands shaking?
Are your fears breaking?
Are you climbing all the walls?
All the time changing, is the noise fading?
'Cause I wanna get it all

I kinda feel like I feel like a summer light
You got me waiting up a thousand miles
Can we stay right here in the sand
Must feel or are you afraid to fall?

Don't look down
Off this high will never hit the ground
Don't look down
See that the sky we're gonna reach it now
Do you feel the lightning inside of you
Will you follow through if I fall for you
Don't look down
Off this high will never hit the ground

[Beat break]

Don't look down

Do you feel the lightning inside of you
Will you follow through if I fall for you
Don't look down
Off this high will never hit the ground
