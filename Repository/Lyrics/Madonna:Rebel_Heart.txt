Rebel Heart 
Madonna

I lived my life like a masochist
Hearing my father say: "Told you so, told you so"
"Why can't you be like the other girls?"
I said: "Oh no, thatâs not me and I don't think that it'll ever beâ

Thought I belong to a different tribe
Walking alone
Never satisfied, satisfied
Tried to fit in but it wasn't me,
I said: âOh no, I want more, that's not what I'm looking forâ

So I took the road less travelled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth of my rebel heart, of my rebel heart

I spent some time as a narcissist
Hearing the other say: "Look at you, look at you"
Trying to be so provocative
I said: "Oh yeah, that was me"
All the things I did just to be seen

Outgrown my past and
I've shed my skin
Letting it go and I'll start again, start again
Never look back
It's a waste of time, I said: "Oh yeah, this is me"
And I'm right here where I wanna be
I said: "Hell yeah! This is me"
Right where I'm supposed to be

So I took the road less travelled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in my rebel heart

So I took the road less travelled by
And I barely made it out alive
Through the darkness somehow I survived
Tough love, I knew it from the start
Deep down in the depth
Of my rebel heart
Of my rebel heart
Of my rebel heart
Of my rebel heart
