Nomadic 
Slipknot

Let's skip all the histrionics
Not again, not another excuse
The epidemic is co dependent
Biting off more than your mouth can do
Don't forget to convalesce your secrets
I don't want to be a man today
For all you know I'm the silver in the bullet
I am the trigger that will make you all obey

I'm gonna make you cry tonight
I'm gonna make you hate me

Inside all my flaws again (I can't let go)
In spite of you I'm lost again (I still fell down)
Disguises show me, what am I if I am only
The status quo is not a punishment
But now it feels like home

Your association finds you guilty/
starting with the end of the day
Black and white is such a fascist feeling/
right or wrong, and nothing to say
The last good bipeds cleaning up the fingerprints
unappreciated medical fiends
Confiscate another classic inbred
Fuck It All- Light The Acetylene
No other choice, I canât explain-Life keeps taking things away

Inside all my flaws again (I can't let go)
In spite of you I'm lost again (I still fell down)
Disguises show me, what am I if I am only
The status quo is not a punishment
But now it feels like home
