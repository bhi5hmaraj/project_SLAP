Vietnam 
Kiesza

[Intro:]
Oooh!
This is why I give in
This is why I give in
This is why I give in

Oooh!
This is why I give in
This is why I give in
This is why I give in

[Verse:]
I'm under your fire
You got me burning up inside, yeah
You use my desire against me
How can I deny it?

[Pre-Chorus]
You consume with your love attacks boy
Blow my pride away and smile about it
Should be running but I can't hold back boy
Vietnam in my emotions

[Chorus:]
If you give it up to me
I'll give it up to you
Cause I can't use my loaded heart against you
These feelings that I bleed
They fight only to lose
But if this is war, I'm falling for you

[Post-Chorus:]
Oooh!
This is why I give in
This is why I give in
This is why I give in

Oooh!
This is why I give in
This is why I give in
This is why I give in

[Verse 2:]
You left me defenseless
Explosions going off inside
Motion for my senses
My conscious caves when we collide, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You consume with your love attacks boy
Blow my pride away and smile about it
Should be running but I can't hold back boy
Vietnam in my emotions

[Chorus:]
If you give it up to me
I'll give it up to you
Cause I can't use my loaded heart against you
These feelings that I bleed
They fight only to lose
But if this is war, I'm falling for you

[Post-Chorus:]
Oooh!
This is why I give in
This is why I give in
This is why I give in

Oooh!
This is why I give in
This is why I give in
This is why I give in

You know my weakness has always been you
There's no shell that I can use
Losing control has never felt so good
I surrender me to you

[Chorus:]
If you give it up to me
I'll give it up to you
Cause I can't use my loaded heart against you
These feelings that I bleed
They fight only to lose
But if this is war, I'm falling for you

[Post-Chorus:]
Oooh!
This is why I give in
This is why I give in
This is why I give in

Oooh!
This is why I give in
This is why I give in
This is why I give in
