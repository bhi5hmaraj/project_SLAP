I'm Gonna Show You Crazy 
Bebe Rexha

[Verse 1]
There's a war inside my head
Sometimes I wish that I was dead, I'm broken
So I call this therapist
And she said girl you can't be fixed just take this
I'm tired of trying to be normal
I'm always overthinking
I'm driving myself crazy
So what if I'm f*cking crazy
And I don't need your quick fix
I don't want your prescriptions
Just 'cause you say I'm crazy
So what if I'm f*cking crazy
Yeah I'm gonna show you

[Chorus]
Loco, maniac, sick bitch, psychopath,
Yeah I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you,
I'm gonna show you,
Mental out my brain, bad sh*t go insane,
Yeah I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you

[Verse 2]
I've been searching city streets
Trying to find the missing piece like you said
And I say child don't need to cry
There's not a single thing that's wrong with my mind
Yeah, I'm tired of tryna be normal
I'm always over thinking
Driving myself crazy
So what if I'm f*cking crazy
And I don't need your quick fix
I don't want your prescriptions
Just cause you say I'm crazy
So what if I'm f*cking crazy
Yeah I'm gonna show you

[Chorus]
Loco, maniac, sick bitch, psychopath,
Yeah I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you,
I'm gonna show you,
Mental out my brain, bad sh*t go insane,
Yeah I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you
