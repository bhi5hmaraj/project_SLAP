New Years' Eve 
Mo

[Verse 1]
Why do some things stay the same, when some don't
We say we'll stay around, oh we know when we won't
I'm a gross teenager, trapped in a grown-up shade
Need someone to clean up the mess I made
Say it will be fine

[Pre-Hook]
Oh, friend, will you fly with me into fire?
It's New Years' Eve
We're allowed tonight to pretend we're free
Promise me, on New Years' Eve

[Hook]
We forget about our problems
We got time to share all of those things in the New Year
Gotta problem, baby let be, hopped on my back
Have a happy New Years' Eve

Have a happy New Years' Eve

[Verse 2]
Why do some things stay the same, when some don't
Now we're all queens on the screen, happy and torn
There we'll stay on, in beautiful
Don't cry, please hon
They said in time, you'll be fine

[Pre-Hook: Variation]
Oh friend, come get high with me
Hand in hand, it's New Years' Eve
We're allowed tonight to pretend we're free
Promise me, on New Years' Eve

[Hook: (x2)]

[Outro]
Get so high, oh
Help me baby sail away, sail away
I'm gonna swim so deep
Oh, let it all go
Baby, have a happy New Years' Eve
Have a happy New Years' Eve
