New Nu 
Keyshia Cole

[Intro:]
Diamonds ain't gon' last so long
The good started feel wrong
I can't believe it ended so fast

[Verse:]
Tell me, you been doin' me so wrong
And I been puttin' up waitin' fo' so long
The minute I say I'm leavin' you wanna try to get me all of these fancy things

[Chorus:]
But baby diamonds ain't gon' work this time
Money ain't gon' help, oh no
And the good dick just don't feel the same
It's such a shame (such a shame) endin' this way

[Verse 2:]
I'm tellin' you that you can go
Cuz I ain't puttin' up wid it no mo'
Ill, I try to stay and work it out
But you don't really wanna be here no
(I'm on that new shit)

[Chorus:]
But baby diamonds ain't gon' work this time
Money ain't gon' help, oh no
And the good dick just don't feel the same
It's such a shame endin' this way

[Bridge:]
I know you get cause, you're seein' anotha
There's no more love, it's left
And I know ya got hoes, you're ballin', it's easy
But please believe it's nothing to me, okey

[Chorus:]
Diamonds ain't gon' work this time
Money ain't gon' help, oh no
And the good dick just don't feel the same
It's such a shame endin' this way
