Wash All Over Me 
Madonna

[Verse:]
In a world that's changing
I'm a stranger in a strange land
There's a contradiction
And I'm stuck here in between
Life is like a desert
An oasis to confuse me
So I walk this crazy ex where has stand where I fall

[Pre-Chorus:]
I don't lie, not trying to pretend that nothing is what it seems
Jump between the impulses,
Stay or running away from all this madness

[Hook:]
Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come
Let it rain
Rain all over me
Like a tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me

[Beat/Instrumental]

[Verse 2:]
All of my illusions
Could be shattered in a second
You can fled a needle with the cheer of from my eyes
It should injustice to be with this, two of things I see
Looking for the answer when it's right in front of me

[Pre-Hook 2]
From the Tower of Babylon where nothing is what it seems
Gonna watch the sun going down
I'm not gonna run from all this sadness

[Hook:]
Who am I
To decide what should be done
If this is the end then let it come
Let it come
Let it rain
Rain all over me
Like a tide, let it flow
Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me
Over me
Let it wash all over me
