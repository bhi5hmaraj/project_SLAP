Heartbreaker 
Nicole Scherzinger

[Intro:]
Never thought that I would live to find another love like mine
Time
Never thought that I could be in a place to ever see it
See it, I

[Chorus:]
I need that heartbreaker
I need something to lose
I need that breath-taker
When it's gone, it leaves a bruise

[Post-Chorus:]
Break my heart
Break my heart, yeah
Break my heart
Break my heart

[Verse:]
I wanna wake up in the morning, appear you've moved on like a stalker
In the middle of the night, I see you're missing from my arms
Where have you gone?
Look what you've done?
So I sit up in this bed and I imagine where you're at
All those playing games with love, I think this time I've met my match
What have I done?
Where have you gone?
See I love it when you take that part of me
It's intoxicating, I can barely breathe
Yes, I love you when you do these things to me
Sing, baby, sing

[Chorus 2:]
I need that heartbreaker
I need someone to lose
I need that breath-taker
When you're gone, it leaves a bruise

[Chorus:]
I need that heartbreaker
I need something to lose
I need that breath-taker
When it's gone, it leaves a bruise

[Post-Chorus:]
Break my heart
Break my heart, yeah
Break my heart
Break my heart

[Bridge:]
What is love? What is love?
What is love? It's up in the air
It's neither here or there, spare
Me the time to explain it
I, I just know how it feels
Too much of it can kill
And not enough of it is real
Just enough of it can heal

[Chorus 2:]
I need that heartbreaker
I need someone to lose
I need that breath-taker
When you're gone, it leaves a bruise

[Post-Chorus:]
Break my heart
Break my heart, yeah
Break my heart
Break my heart

[Post-Chorus:]
Break my heart
Break my heart, yeah
Break my heart
Break my heart

[Outro:]
Break my heart
Break my heart
Ooh, show me that it's real
Yeah, I love how it feels
