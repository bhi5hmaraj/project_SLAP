Erryday 
Tyga

T-Raww
Do this shit erryday

Iâm making money nigga erryday, erryday, erryday
She making promises erryday, erryday, erryday
Iâm sipping somethinâ smoking mary jane, mary jane, erryday
Kilos of gold on erryday, erryday, itâs pay day

Mozart with the Mulsanne
Most hated with the most chains
Iâm polar bear on my ice game
You pointing fingers, someone to blame
Iâm sick of shit, nigga, tired of liars
So high feel like dying
No reparations, no check for slavery
My current location somewhere in Vegas
Man I hope I make it, hope I make it
Godâs plan, not even you can save me
Canât.. Baby, Iâm a.. Baby
I need baby like a more baby
Need dÃ©cor baby, my house amazinâ
Went so low like a temptation
Shit gettinâ rough, gotta be abrasive
Signs of things, gotta keep a banger
Fuck that, when you ends low canât trust nobody
My back against the wall and I donât fuck with nobody
Know somebody caught a body and he haunted, I donât want that
Count your blessings, stop complaininâ
Be precision with your aiminâ
Cause Iâm

Iâm making money nigga erryday, erryday, erryday
She making promises erryday, erryday, erryday
Iâm sipping somethinâ smoking mary jane, mary jane, erryday
Kilos of gold on erryday, erryday, itâs pay day

(Wish you knew somebody, wish you knew that keep it quiet
Ainât new to this island, if you knew me you be silent
Everyday thatâs a new bitch in my face, what you say
Pop that Rollie in my case and my space like nasa sponsor)
Pussy monster, chop that nonsense, it get violent round my way
.. Better make your mind up, start that engine, need you start us
Iâm typically not normal, I ainât atheist so believe in me
All about my currency, dollar signs and kingery
(T-Raww)
The new Messiah, follow me into your freedom
I can lead you, swear of allegiance
No more pain and grievinâ
Suffer long from dreaminâ
When I know whatâs up with me and Wiz Khalifa
But me and Wiz Khalifa smokinâ reefer
Then Iâm flyinâ private to a feature cause

Iâm making money nigga erryday, erryday, erryday
She making promises erryday, erryday, erryday
Iâm sipping somethinâ smoking mary jane, mary jane, erryday
Kilos of gold on erryday, erryday, itâs pay day
