Weak Heart 
Zara Larsson

Early morning someone's calling
Who could this be?
Reach my phone and your name showing on my caller-id
I took - changed my mind and call you back-up
You say hey, I say hey there
We don't say much
It's almost like singing that sad song
You make it so easy to hang-on
'Cause I'm a weak heart, baby
I'm a weak heart, yeah
I am such a weak heart, baby I'm a weak heart, yeah
When it comes to you
I put my money on a long shot
(I got it, I got it, I got it)
When it comes to you
It's like - but I can't stop
(I got it, I got it, I got it)
Yeah I'm a weak heart, baby I'm a weak heart
You come over
I say slow down this can't go on
Grab a chair, please
Sit right it's time we have a talk
Talk leads to touches and then it's on to the next
Body to body until I'm cathing my breath
This is not what I'm supposed to do
Trying to get of but I'm stuck on you
So I'm gonna keep singing this sad song
It never felt better to be wrong
'Cause I'm a weak heart, baby I'm a weak heart, yeah
Such a weak heart, baby I'm a weak heart, yeah
When it comes to you
I put my money on a long shot
(I got it, I got it, I got it)
When it comes to you
It's like - but I can't stop
(I got it, I got it, I got it)
Yeah I'm a weak heart, baby I'm a weak heart
