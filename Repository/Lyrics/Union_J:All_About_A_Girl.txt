All About A Girl 
Union J

[Josh]
We fell in love so quickly
Her smile lit up the city
Just like a million lights
(Just like a million lights)
Yeah, we burned out, we lost it
Didn't know just what I wanted
I wanna go back to that night
Cause since that day
(Ooh, ooh)

[Jaymi]
I've been searching all my life for you
(You, you)
I've been all the way
From Verona to California
I tried to find you
You're my world
Nobody told me that my love story
Would be all about, be all about
Be all about a girl

[Josh]
It's all about a girl
It's all about a girl
It's all about, it's all about, it's all about a girl

[George]
Every place I've been through
I think that I see you
New York, London, LA
And every melody of

[JJ]
Every song I sing to
Always reminds me of you
But still I wanna press play

[Josh]
Cause since that day
(Ooh, ooh)

[Jaymi]
I've been searching all my life for you
(You, ooh)

[All]
I've been all the way from Verona to California
I tried to find you
You're my world

[Josh]

[All]
Nobody told me that my love story
Would be all about, be all about
Be all about a girl

[Josh]
It's all about a girl
It's all about a girl
It's all about, it's all about, it's all about a girl

[Jaymi]
I've been all the way

[Josh]
I was waiting all my life for you (ooh)
I've been searching all the world for you (ooh)
Everything's reminded me of you (ooh)

[All]
From Verona to California
I tried to find you
You're my world
(You're my world)
Nobody told me that my love story
Would be all about, be all about
Be all about a girl

[Josh]
It's all about a girl
It's all about a girl
It's all about, it's all about, it's all about a girl
It's all about, it's all about, it's all about a girl
