Torn Apart 
Bastille

[Verse 1]
I could only be myself, with you around.
Oh, with you around.
And now there's nothing left for me to think about.
Woah, to think about.

[Pre-Chorus]
And it hurts like hell,
To be torn apart.
And it hurts like hell,
To be thrown around.

[Chorus]
We were born to be together,
Torn apart. Torn apart.
We were born to be together,
Torn apart. Torn apart.

[Verse 2]
You stamped with a heavy tread and left your mark
Oh, your mark on me
The space you used to fill is now this great black hole
Oh, you're out of sight but not out of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And it hurts like hell,
To be torn apart.
And it hurts like hell,
To be thrown around.

[Chorus]
We were born to be together,
Torn apart. Torn apart.
We were born to be together,
Torn apart. Torn apart.

[Interlude]

[Chorus x2]
We were born to be together
Torn apart, torn apart
We were born to be together
Torn apart, torn apart
