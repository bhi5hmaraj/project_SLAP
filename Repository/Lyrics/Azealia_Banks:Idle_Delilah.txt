Idle Delilah 
Azealia Banks

[Verse:]
Idle Miss Delilah
Darling, do you like beige in your
Coffee? Tea? A wild-? Wild breeze
On a day, a dawn
Oft indeed a child, smiles at me
Cause I'm made of yarn
Dolly, me? Am I?
I'll trade a dollar for you dime, I'll
Idle Miss Delilah
Drowning trees remind me of my
Darling D the diver
Diver D was a sinner of
Father
Made him run away with the stale lung
Following me a mile
Idle Miss Delilah

[Chorus:]
Darling Miss Delilah
While you're wasting your days alone
All your friends are higher
All your friends are just
Try to cheat the dial
Look the other way
It can't play out wrong
Are you suicidal?
Are you in denial?
Idle Miss Delilah
While you wake for my latest song
Glad to see you smile
Glad to see you so stable
Was all of these divided by the
Pilot... On the nape of your
Dolly me? Am I?
I'll trade a dollar for your dime
I'll take you

[Verse 2:]
Slick... Stack on 3 high

Can't deal with the bullshit cause the crap ain't me
He took you to cruise ships, put a yacht on me
He said the puss deeper than the deep blue sea
Indeed the puss deeper than the three foot jeans
