The British Are Coming 
Weezer

This is the night, light up the fire in the forge
We're not the coins in the coffer of old king George

One if by land two if they come by sea
We'll show them we are the true sons of liberty

Punk ass redcoats trying to run the show
Telling me what to do and where to go
Mount your horse cause it's time to tell the world

The British are coming
The British are coming
The British are coming

Smear on the soot
Tear up an old deer skin shirt
We know the shot will be heard all around the world

Punk ass redcoats trying to run the show
Telling me what to do and where to go
Mount your horse cause it's time to tell the world

The British are coming
The British are coming
The British are coming

This is the destiny of all mankind
We will shake off these chains and shackles that bind
Come on let's give them everything we have

The British are coming
The British are coming
The British are coming
