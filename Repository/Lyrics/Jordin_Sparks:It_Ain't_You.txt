It Ain't You 
Jordin Sparks

Dude swear he a boss
Still living with his moms
Stay fresh though
And you wonder why it ain't you
Ooh ooh
Why it ain't you
Oooh ooh oh

This one is for all my ladies
All these fellas in these songs talking crazy
More than loyal I'm royal
And you can bet, look better than I do on the Internet
Take a step back 'cause I'm too fresh
Need a pack of gum doo-doo breath
You're not an O.G. you're an OMG
You can say hi but don't touch me
Already know who I wanna talk to
Got my eye on him when I walk through
Yeah, we came here to party
I ain't tryna see your fucking car keys

I'm a little too smart for you babe
I may look pretty, but I've got a brain
Need a pause, here's some twix
Hope it keeps you busy, boy I'm really over it

Dude swear he a boss
Still living with his moms
Stay fresh though
And you wonder why it ain't you
Ooh ooh
Why it ain't you
Oooh ooh oh

Even after a couple shots
My type you are not
So many girls up in here, why me
You already done flopped, wipe pretty
Got curl like my curls
Couldn't get with me, now you try my girl
Please!
Did your mama help you get dressed
Boy say it with your chest
Say VIP is where I gotta be
Cause I can't get people up offa me
Acting all drunk like you wanna fight
But you've been sipping on the same drink the whole night
Stepping up like a jerk
Who in the world told you that shit would work?
I am the fliest boss up in this skirt
Me and my ladies run this thing, you heard!

Dude swear he a boss
Still living with his moms
Stay fresh though
And you wonder why it ain't you
Ooh ooh
Why it ain't you
Oooh ooh oh

Wondering why it ain't you
You don't even know what to do
Ooh, why why why why why why
Straight fair, I'm a win you're an error

Dude swear he a boss
Still living with his moms
He stay fresh though
And you wonder why it ain't you
Ooh ooh
Why it ain't you
Oooh ooh oh
Yeah yeah

This one is for all my ladies
All these fellas in these songs talking crazy
This one is for all my ladies
All these fellas in these songs talking crazy

...And that's it
