Riverman 
Noel Gallagher

There's something in the way she moves me to distraction
I traveled all this way to try and make amends
Cause heavy in the air are the words that she left hanging
I tried to walk away but I only stand and stare

The rain that comes
All of the love that was left behind is gone
When the riverman runs
Brought me the girl who electrified the storm
Cos in a little while she'll be gone

I waited in the rain
My feet too wet to stand in
I shouted out your name
Behind a rainbow's end

But somewhere in the crowd she heard me jingle jangling
Like a memory that fades
She slipped away again

The rain that comes
All of the love that was left behind is gone
When the riverman runs
Brought me the girl who electrified the storm
When the rain that comes
All of the love that was left behind is gone
When the riverman runs
Brought me the girl who electrified the storm
Cos in a little while she'll be gone

The riverman runs
The riverman runs
The riverman runs
The riverman runs
