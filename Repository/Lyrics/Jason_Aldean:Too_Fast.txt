Too Fast 
Jason Aldean

[Verse:]
I want to be the man that you thought I was
I want to be the man that made you fall in love
I can't undo everything I've done
But let me tell you right now
Baby, you're the only one

[Chorus:]
I don't want to be a restless soul
Running on empty, burning up the road
Never knowing what I'm trying to find
While the wheels keep turning in the back of my mind
I don't want to take the long way home
Sleeping on the roadside, move along
Heading about, foot on the gas, living my life too fast

[Verse 2:]
I've been making a living, not making a life
And knowing that now, well it cuts like a knife
The way it's been ain't how it's gonna be
Baby, starting right now, gonna give you the best of me

[Chorus:]
I don't want to be a restless soul
Running on empty, burning up the road
Never knowing what I'm trying to find
While the wheels keep turning in the back of my mind
I don't want to take the long way home
Sleeping on the roadside, move along
Heading about, foot on the gas, living my life too fast

[Bridge:]
Ooh, I've been a rolling stone
I think it's time for me to roll on home

[Chorus:]
I don't want to be a restless soul
Running on empty, burning up the road
Never knowing what I'm trying to find
While the wheels keep turning in the back of my mind
I don't want to take the long way home
Sleeping on the roadside, move along
Heading about, foot on the gas, living my life too fast

Living my life too fast
