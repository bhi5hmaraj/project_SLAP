Bite Down 
Bastille

[Verse 1: Bastille]
You don't have to look any further
I've been waiting here for you for time
You don't have to look any further
You're missing what is right before your eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Bastille &amp; HAIM]
No one's gonna stick the pieces
Together for you, together for you
No one's gonna stick the pieces
Together for you, together for you
(You've got your claws buried deep)

[Chorus: Bastille &amp; HAIM]
Bite down, bite down into me
Bite down, bite down into me
You better sink your teeth before I disappear
Bite down, bite down to me

[Post-Chorus: Bastille &amp; HAIM]
Ooh, I'm not gonna try
Ooh, I'm not gonna try
Ooh, I'm not gonna try
No, no, no, I'm not gonna try

[Verse 2: Bastille]
Oh, I'm trying to keep my composure
But every time you're shaking me down, I die
Are you gonna keep looking me over?
I'm tired of waving my arms from the back of the line

[Pre-Chorus: Bastille &amp; HAIM]
No one's gonna stick the pieces
Together for you, together for you
No one's gonna stick the pieces
Together for you, together for you
(You've got your claws buried deep)

[Chorus: Bastille &amp; HAIM]
Bite down, bite down into me
Bite down, bite down into me
You better sink your teeth before I disappear
Bite down, bite down to me

[Bridge: Bastille &amp; HAIM]
âCause there are only so many times
That I can come running
âCause there are only so many times
That I can come running for you

[Chorus x2]
Bite down, bite down into me
Bite down, bite down into me
You better sink your teeth before I disappear
Bite down, bite down tino me
