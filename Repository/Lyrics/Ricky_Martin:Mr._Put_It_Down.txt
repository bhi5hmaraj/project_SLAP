Mr. Put It Down 
Ricky Martin

[Pitbull Rap]
Now first of all
Come on baby take it off,
Come on baby break me off
Then she said she loves the fact
That Pitbull's such a dog!
It's simple baby, I ain't picky.
Only rule of mine is no hickeys
Remember, lust can get tricky.
It's Mr. Worldwide and Ricky, dale

Went from the block to the yacht to the G4

Not from Maryland
But when it always comes to women there can always be more
Get it? Be more
