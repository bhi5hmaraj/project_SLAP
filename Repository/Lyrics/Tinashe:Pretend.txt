Pretend 
Tinashe

[Intro: A$Ap Rocky]
Yeah, itâs almost like
Canât nobody do it quite like
I do it right
Give it to you how you like

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
Can we pretend
That everything is like yesterday
What if I just wanna feel you touching me?
Ainât nobody perfect
So if you take a while to make it worth it
I wanna pretend
Letâs pretend that we âbout to break up
To catch the feelings that I when we make up
Legs up, suicide, north side
We never count points when we courtside

[Pre-Chorus 1: Tinashe]
Letâs pretend I ainât your friend
So we can get it on again
Letâs pretend we never met
A good excuse to play forget
Letâs pretend you never lied
So I can give it up all night
Swallow my pride, and learn to forgive
When Iâm looking for love I pretend

[Chorus: Tinashe]
Itâs you
A love that never ends
I pretend itâs you
That Iâm in love with

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
If we pretend that Iâm happy when Iâm really not
Pretend that I give you everything Iâve got
Pretend that Iâm there when I ainât there
Pretend that I care when I donât care
Once upon a time, I did
Now I admit that I was fucking with a kid
Now I pretend that everythingâs straight
When everything ex covered up like pain

[Pre-Chorus 2: Tinashe]
Letâs pretend itâs my first time
So you can really blow my mind
Letâs pretend we never met
A good excuse to play forget
Letâs pretend you never lied
So I can give it up all night
Swallow my pride, and learn to forgive
When Iâm looking for love I pretend

[Chorus: Tinashe]

[Verse 3: A$Ap Rocky]
To never fool around with you was my best deed
Stand up, got a heart up on my left sleeve
When I could find another lover by the next week
Besties turn to ex-ies from a pep tease
Fuck what these other niggas on, I came to flaunt
Whatâs that A$Ap little sailor on?
Probably what youâre thinking âbout, the commas in my bank account
Pretty bitches bring em out, jiggy nigga in the house
When I caught her dancing by the couch
With her little booty hanging out
Sticking something in her stomach
Got her screaming out âIâm comingâ, fronting like you really want it
Still my nigga though

[Chorus: Tinashe]

[Outro: Tinashe]
Can we pretend?
