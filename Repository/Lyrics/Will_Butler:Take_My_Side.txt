Take My Side 
Will Butler

Where's the fire? Let it burn
Where're the children? Oh, children, you gotta learn
I'll tell you why when I figure it out myself
Oh, please don't cry; your crying, it ain't gonna help

Where we going? Where you taking me?
If you want it, you know you can set me free
I'd tell you why but I'm having problems with my words
If I could fly, you know I'd beat the shit out of some birds

I remember when we were pretty young
Where we'd often run together to the setting of the sun
Oh, we swore we're friends forever, so before you run and hide, just tell me:

[Chorus:]
Are you gonna take my side?
Are you gonna take my side?
Are you be on my side or their side?
Are you gonna take my side?

What's the difference if I'm wrong?
Keep on acting, we'll never get along
I'll tell you why but you'd probably figure it out yourself
Oh, you're so wise, you best put that book back on the shelf

I remember when we were pretty young
Where we often stayed together to the rising of the sun
Oh, we swore we're friends forever, so before you run and hide, just tell me:

[Chorus:]

I remember when we were pretty young
Where we often sing together to the rising of the sun
Oh, we swore we'd be together, so before you run and hide, just tell me:

[Chorus:]

Oh, you know that I would die
If I couldn't [?], you're not on my side
Tell your mother, take my side
Tell your father too, take my side
