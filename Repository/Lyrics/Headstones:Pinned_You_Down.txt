Pinned You Down 
Headstones

What the hell we create
Push on and punch your head
All throw roast is overrated
Kill the time and didn't lost that war I misstated
Now it's time to stop and hate
Way before the pain over kills
And I just stay on presidential, and I'm naked on every [?]

See they pinned you down
See they pinned you down
See they pinned you down
See they pinned you

Wake up late and n***a it's all for resting and let the rest to take a move
Lately we've been hitting all on post and it's frustration and you don't like
this [?]
Eliminate the time and the day you go from [?]
Every one you know is pinned you down

So they they pinned you down
See they pinned you down
See they pinned you down
See they pinned you down
See they pinned you down
See they pinned you
