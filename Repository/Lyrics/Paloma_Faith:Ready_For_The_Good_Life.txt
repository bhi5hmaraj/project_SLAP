Ready For The Good Life 
Paloma Faith

Baby give me diamonds
Give me gold
Take the pain, we, from in my soul

Yeah, I'm ready for the good life

Cause I've been saving
Gave it all I got
It took the best of me, was not enough

Yeah, I'm ready for the good life

Let me sing now

Tell me I'm a diva
Take away my pin
I know I give you fever tonight
Dancing to my rhythm
It's time for me to shine
Shake it for the living and shout: I'm ready for the good life

I'm ready for the good life
I'm ready for the good life

It's my time now
Tell everyone
The ones that press me
They better run

Yeah, I'm ready for the good life

I'm gonna get mine, before I'm old
I'm coming up now, In control

Yeah, I'm ready for the good life

Tell me I'm a diva
Take away my pin
I know I give you fever tonight
Dancing to my rhythm
It's time for me to shine
Shake it for the living and shout: I'm ready for the good life

Ooh, I can't let go of this feeling
That's when the ceiling
Singing yeah
Don't call me child if you're with me
Let me hear you say yeah

Yeah, I'm ready for the good life
Come on

Tell me I'm a diva
Take away my pin
I know I give you fever tonight
Dancing to my rhythm
It's time for me to shine
Shake it for the living and shout: I'm ready for the good life

Tell me I'm a diva
Take away my pin
I know I give you fever tonight
Dancing to my rhythm
It's time for me to shine
Shake it for the living and shout: I'm ready for the good life
