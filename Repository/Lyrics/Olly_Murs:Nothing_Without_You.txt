Nothing Without You 
Olly Murs

[Verse:]
I pretend I'm a happy, lyin' man
But it's easy 2 lie when I don't understand
Neva thought I'd be runnin' back so soon
But I don't believe in nothin' without ya
There's a part 2 be hopin', there's a chance
That ya look in his eyes & hold his hands
I don't care about findin' someone new
Cause I don't believe in nothin' without ya

[Chorus:]
Thought I had nothin' 2 lose
Thought I had nothin' 2 prove 2 you
& I wasted all this time, I'm sorry
Funny, only now I know it's true
Baby, I got nothin' without ya

[Verse 2:]
Since ya left I'm a cartoon of myself
I'm a mess, I'm a joke, I'm someone else
I keep tellin' this story like it's bad news
Cause I don't believe in nothin' without ya

[Chorus:]
Thought I had nothin' 2 lose
Thought I had nothin' 2 prove 2 ya
& I wasted all this time, I'm sorry
Funny, only now I know it's true
Baby, I got nothin' without ya

[Bridge:]
I know that I'm a devil
I know that it's a long shot
I'd do everythin' I can do
Cause you're everythin' that I've got, I've got

[Chorus:]
Thought I had nothin' 2 lose
I thought I had nothin' 2 prove 2 ya
& I wasted all this time, I'm sorry
Funny, only now I know it's true
Baby, I got nothin' without ya
& I wasted all this time, I'm sorry
Funny, only now I know it's true
Baby, I got nothin' without ya
