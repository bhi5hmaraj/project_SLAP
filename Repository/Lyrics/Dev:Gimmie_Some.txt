Gimmie Some 
Dev

[Chorus:]
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie
Gimmie some, gimmie some, gimmie
Gimmie some, gimmie some, gimmie
Sh-show you how I want it
So you can gimmie somethin'
Gimmie some, gimmie some, gimmie
You can gimmie some, gimmie some, gimmie

[Verse:]
Breathless impatience
Grows with every moment
Been waitin', countin'
One two three, one two three (2, 3)

[Pre-Chorus:]
You're killin' me with just one look
And you don't have to say a word
With every little glance I'm hooked
So I don't wanna hear it

[Chorus:]
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie
Gimmie some, gimmie some, gimmie
Gimmie some, gimmie some, gimmie
Sh-show you how I want it
So you can gimmie somethin'
Gimmie some, gimmie some, gimmie
You can gimmie some, gimmie some, gimmie

[Verse 2:]
My tensions, ambitions
Fulfilled with every moment
Together, we're counting
One two three, one two three (2, 3)

[Pre-Chorus:]
You're killin' me with just one look
And you don't have to say a word
With every little glance I'm hooked
So I don't wanna hear it

[Chorus:]
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie
Gimmie some, gimmie some, gimmie
Gimmie some, gimmie some, gimmie
Sh-show you how I want it
So you can gimmie somethin'
Gimmie some, gimmie some, gimmie
You can gimmie some, gimmie some, gimmie
