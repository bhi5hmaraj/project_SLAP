Colors 
Genevieve

[Chorus]
Show your colors girl in the morning light
It's on again, it's on again
Recreate the world in your own good vibes
It's on again, it's on again

Show your colors girl, show show your colors girl, gotta show your colors girl!


[Verse 1]
I wake up thinking bout my purpose
And wonder if I'm really worth it
It's all been sung before and you've all heard it
Your life is your design, so go ahead and design it.
Your star is in the sky, so go ahead align it.
Cause your forever lost, until you go and find it.
(Go, go! )
Go find it!


[Chorus]
Show your colors girl in the morning light
It's on again, it's on again
Recreate the world in your own good vibes
It's on again, it's on again
It's all in your head, in your head, in your head
Show your colors girl, show your colors girl

[Verse 2]
My life requires certain gears
I'm making faces in the mirror
And when it's hard to let go of my fears
Your life is your design, so go ahead design it.
Your star is in the sky, so go ahead align it.
Cause your forever lost, until you go and find it.


[Chorus]
Show your colors girl in the morning light
It's on again, it's on again
Recreate the world in your own good vibes
It's on again, it's on again
It's all in your head, in your head, in your head
Show your colors girl, show your colors girl

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Show your colors girl in the morning light
It's on again, it's on again
Recreate the world in your own good vibes
It's on again, it's on again
It's all in your head, in your head, in your head.
Show your colors girl, show show your colors girl, show your colors girl,
Show show your colors girl, show your colors girl...
