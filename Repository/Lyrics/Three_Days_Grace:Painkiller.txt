Painkiller 
Three Days Grace

You know you need a fix when you fall down
You know you need to find a way to get you through another day
Let me be the one to numb you out
Let me be the one to hold you
Never gonna let you get away

The shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on

I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
Love me 'til it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

I know what you want so desperately
You know I'll give you one for free
Forever you're coming back to me
Now I'm gonna give you what you need
'Cause I know what you feed on and what you lead on
And what you lead on

The shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on

I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
Love me 'til it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

Did you find the another cure?
Did you find the another cure?

I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
Love me 'til it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
Painkiller
