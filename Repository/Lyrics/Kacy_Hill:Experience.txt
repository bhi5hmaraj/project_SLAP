Experience 
Kacy Hill

Queue the soft recordings
Float through dreams and still
Be a soft kind of prison
Jail vows unfulfilled
Drink a soft kind of prison
Jail vows unfulfilled
Breathe a soft kind of prison
Jail vows unfulfilled

Freedom, a state of mind
Sold to watering eyes
Substances controlled
To protect their mind
Substances controlled
To protect their mind
Substances controlled
To protect their mind
Substances controlled
To protect their mind
Substances controlled
To protect their mind

One did offer itself to unravel every inch
Shower your body each instant
Experience so real

Got no taste of success
Love fulfills her rights
Becoming our Earth
Skin covered in dirt
Becoming our Earth
Skin covered in dirt
Becoming our Earth
Skin covered in dirt
Skin covered in dirt
Skin covered in dirt
Skin covered in dirt
Covered in dirt, covered in dirt

Rain, bridge a nasty wall
body fills it up
First, where's the water source in each breath, each fall?
