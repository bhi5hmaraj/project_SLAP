Gotti 
Lil Wayne

[Intro:]
C5, D-Block, lox

[Verse 1: The lox]
Say the judge or the jury can't spoil this
Nah two thirds of the worlds most loyalest
I'mma shoot em
I'mma pay the bail I'm sure of this
I'mma kill em I'mma get the witness, teach 'em more of this
We never sing not even on a song where the chorus is
Dig the hole, get the wood box bring the florist in
Tell the pastor tell the family we was just warning them
38's 45's, all type of tourists'
About to hit the bong pour the holy water in
Celebrating for participating and the slaughtering
Eating steaks at the same spot they killed Pauly in
Frank White's three in the quarter taping your daughter in
Columbia with the connect putting the order in
Nigga act we gonna clap like we the audience
Make sure you ain't down to strap, get rid of all the prints
Do your homework on whoever you go to war against

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I had 20s on my Benz, lend it to all my friends
And everything was all gravy, everything was all gravy
And if I need something call baby, if I need something call baby
And the streets was calling me, but a nigga had call waiting
And yeah we all went through our phases
We all went through our savings
Some niggas stayed on point, some niggas was point shaving
And sometimes we had to be vegetables
That mean we had to stay patient cause they say you are what you eat
I took the Star out of Starvation, bitch
I come from a 3rd world start rapping in the 4th grade
Start trapping in the 6th grade, went platinum in the 10th grade, dropped out a
nigga was getting paid
This from Birdman had a Fade,
This when Hummers didn't come Stretch but Birdman had em' made,
This when pretty bitches set you up, and niggas didn't give two fucks
You had two guns and two phones you could waste time and get and get a new cup
But this when niggas had pimp cups, and new rappers got hemped up
And all them niggas that's biting got they Finns cut...
I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like "that's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"

[Hook:]
And we gon be around til yo motherfuckin' body rock
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
But this when niggas had pimp cups, and dirty money got rinsed up
And the early birds in the worm hole would get so fat that they'd get stuck
We'd clean our fingerprints up, we'd clean the shit we didn't touch, This when
niggas called Diddy Puff
Letting Biggie bump while I'm sitting up in that Big Body
I can show you a dead body
Lotta niggas got pinched, and the snitches ended up dead Lobsters
Wrap the birds in red tape call them bitches Red Robins
Pops had Kilos I needed one key I would've made Cops
Free My niggas Down and Rest In peace to all my dead Partners,
I smoke by the pound in like a week, and fuck the weight watchers
Got my self a brand new triple-beam, just the weight options
I stumbled upon a Gold Mine I thank God that it ain't Copper
Some niggas were late bloomers but boy look how they've blossomed
Don't know niggas that wear wires but I know niggas that go Haywire
I know hoes that play possum, and will bring us to y'all mailboxes
And the deadman can't talk and the Feds don't have seances
Look you put a knot on the end of a condom full of drugs and put it in her
pussy
And get through Customs cause last time we just took em
I rather be blind before I be the nigga that stand around just lookin'
And you can beat around the bush and find a nigga laying behind them bushes
And I know real niggas gon' fuck with this
Like "that's that shit I be talkin' 'bout"

[Hook:]
And we gon be around til yo motherfuckin' body rock
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti Got

[Outro:]
