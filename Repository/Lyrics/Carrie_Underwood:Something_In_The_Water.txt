Something In The Water 
Carrie Underwood

He said I've been where you've been before
Down every hallway's a slamming door
No way out, no one to come and save me
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave you
There's somebody saying what I'm saying to you
Open my eyes and told me truth
He said: just a little faith and it'll all get better
So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm changed
And now I'm stronger

There must've been something in the water
Oh there must've been something in the water

Well I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
I was all out of hoping, all out of fight
Couldn't fight back the tears so I fell on my knees
Saying God if you're there come and rescue me
Felt love pouring down from above
Got washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm changed

And now I'm stronger

There must be something in the water
Oh there must be something in the water

And now I'm singing all along to amazing grace
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thank God almighty I saw the light
Going to look ahead, no turning back
live everyday, give it all that I have
Trusted someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am changed

And now I'm stronger

There must be been something in the water
Oh there must be something in the water
Oh there must be something in the water
Oh there must be something in the water
Oh yeah

I'm stronger
Stronger

I'm free
