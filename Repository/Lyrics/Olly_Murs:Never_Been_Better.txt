Never Been Better 
Olly Murs

[Verse:]
Burning through the sky
There's no gravity
Hunger in my eyes
Ain't no stopping me
Can't bring me down
I guess it goes around
Heart over my head
Back against the wall
one hundred %, not afraid to fall
I risk it all
When it comes to call

[Pre-Chorus:]
Tell me now did I get your attention?
Did you get the answer to your question?

[Chorus:]
Everybody cries
But not today, but not today
Cause I won't let ya
Everybody dies
But not today, not me
Cause I've never been better

[Verse 2:]
I'm still on my feet
The world can't knock me down
Cause I won't take defeat
I'm still chasing the crown
But I'm still around
Look who's winning now

[Pre-Chorus:]
Tell me now did I get your attention?
Did you hear the answer to your question?

[Chorus:]
Everybody cries
But not today, but not today
Cause I won't let ya
Everybody dies
But not today, not me
Cause I've never been better

[Bridge 1:]
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh Oh, Oh
All together,
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Ooohhhh,
I've never been better
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
All together,
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,
Cause I've never been better

[Verse 3:]
I'm never giving up
No such thing as enough
I keep on winning
Just beginning to get all that I want
Nothing can hold me back
Cause I'm not made for that
I'm always good but I've been better lately

[Chorus:]
Everybody cries
But not today, but not today
Cause I won't let ya
Everybody dies
But not today, not me
Cause I've never been better

[Bridge 2:]
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh Oh, Oh
All together,
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Ooohhhh,
I've never been better
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
All together,
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, OOWWWW
Cause I've never been better

[Chorus:]
Everybody cries
But not today, but not today
Cause I won't let ya
Everybody dies
But not today, not me
Cause I've never been better

[Bridge 3:]
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh Oh, Oh
All together,
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Ooohhhh,
I've never been better
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
All together,
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh,
Cause I've never been better
