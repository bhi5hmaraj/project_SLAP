Run Run Run 
Kelly Clarkson

[Verse: Kelly Clarkson]
I wonder how you your body tastes
Inside of someone else's place
Pull away ur eyes, there's nothin' left to hear
I'm alone but I know everythin' you fear

[Chorus]
And you waited on the rain, for tears my heart is caged
And we fall through fate & we rise & rise again
And I run-run-run-run-run-run
And I run-run-run-run-run-run
I run-run-run-run-run-run
I just run-run-run-run

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Tell me how you close the door knowin' nobody can love you more
Tellin' all ur friends that this love is just made for bleedin'
Oh, on & under water but still we keep on tryna breathe in

[Chorus]
And you waited on the rain, for tears my heart is caged
And we fall through fate & we rise & rise again
And I run-run-run-run-run-run
And I run-run-run-run-run-run
I run-run-run-run-run-run
I just run-run-run-run

[Bridge]
Our love is for fightin'
Tied up in silence

[Chorus]
And you waited on the rain, for tears my heart is caged
And we fall through fate & we rise & rise again
And I run-run-run-run-run-run
And I run-run-run-run-run-run
I run-run-run-run-run-run
I just run-run-run-run

[Bridge]
Our love is for fightin'
Tied up in silence
