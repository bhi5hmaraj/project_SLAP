Don't Be Gone Too Long 
Chris Brown

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Don't be gone too long
Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long (too long)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
