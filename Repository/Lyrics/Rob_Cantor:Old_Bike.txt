Old Bike 
Rob Cantor

Old bike, rode it my whole life
Wonder if I might beat that old bike to the grave
Moon bright, gliding down hillsides
Haze off a porch light flickers and catches my gaze

On my bicycle, rolling along
On my bicycle, singing my song
On my bicycle ride, hoping you'll come along

Warm night, riding my soul bike
Doesn't quite roll right but it gets me where I need to be
There is no guide, life is a slow ride
If you got a old bike come ride around here with me

On our bicycles, hands in the air
On our bicycles, driving with care
On our bicycle ride

Everyone's at it alone sometimes
But it's better to have a companion ride
Everyone's saturday night goes wrong sometimes
Along the ride

Busted and rickety olden bike
Busted and missing a bolt or five
Holding together as long as I'm alive
Along the ride

Ladies and gentlemen I despise
Leave em alone as I drive on by
Never imagined it quite so divine to glide
Along the ride
