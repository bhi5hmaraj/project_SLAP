Hope 
Natasha Bedingfield

Remember morning always comes
As night surrenders to the sun
No matter how dark it may become
Don't stop your light from shining on
'Cause nothing's ever over till you say it's over
And nothing's ever finished
Not unless you walk away

You see I've got hope

Oh oh
I've got hope
So you could use a little, use a little
Leave it when you've done it
And I won't let go
'Cause with a little, with a little it can go a long way
Hoooo-ope hooooo-ope, hoooo-ope
I've got hope

It's easier to say you can't when you know you can,
It's easier to let go then to hold somebody's hand
But if you do, then you might just understand yeah
That it's okay to not know where you're gonna end

I've got hope
So you could use a little, use a little
Leave it when you've done it
And I won't let go
'Cause with a little, with a little it can go a long way
I've got hope
So you could use a little, use a little
Leave it when you've done it
And I won't let go
'Cause with a little, with a little it can go a long way

Ooh oh oh oh oh, you need hope
Oooh oh oh oh oooh, I got hope

You see, I've got hope
So you could use a little, use a little
Leave it when you've done it
And I won't let go
'Cause with a little, with a little it can go a long way
I've got hope
So you could use a little, use a little
Leave it when you've done it
And I won't let go
'Cause with a little, with a little it can go a long way
I've got hope

Give me hope
I need a hand, I need a hand, I need a hand
