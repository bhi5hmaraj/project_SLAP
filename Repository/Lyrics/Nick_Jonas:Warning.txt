Warning 
Nick Jonas

This prison in my head
Oh I, own many mistakes from all the things
I never did
I carry my defense

Now I'm running for the fences on my own

And I can see the warning
Yeah I can see the warning, warning
It's brighter than the morning, morning
Keeps trying to turn me right around
And it's all I ever wanted
It's all I ever wanted, wanted
I'm breaking the warning down, down


I, I got something inside it keeps burning my body til it's sore

Keeps wanting more and more
And I can see the warning
Yeah I can see the warning, warning
It's brighter than the morning, morning
Keeps trying to turn me right around

And it's all I ever wanted
It's all I ever wanted, wanted
I'm breaking the warning down, down

I'm breaking the warning
I'm breaking the warning
I'm breaking the warning
Down

Now I'm running for the fences on my own
And I can see the warning
Yeah I can see the warning, warning
It's brighter than the morning, morning
Keeps trying to turn me right around

And it's all I ever wanted
It's all I ever wanted, wanted

I'm breaking the warning down, down

I'm breaking the warning
I'm breaking the warning
I'm breaking the warning

Yeah
Breaking the warning down, down
Breaking the warning down, down
