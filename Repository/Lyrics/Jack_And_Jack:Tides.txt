Tides 
Jack And Jack

When the tide hits you straight in the face
Life is getting harder treading water, got nowhere to go
And as the time slips away, day by day
Stranded in the ocean, every open door has now been closed
Deadbolt locked, no escape
Feeling like an outcast, so out of place
And I know the tides might take you away
But don't you worry there's no hurry for tomorrow
Cause today's still young

Now you've hit rock bottom and you're feeling lost at sea
Just keep your head above the water
And I know you'll find some way to breathe
When the tides they drag you down
When the tides they drag you down
Down under, wetter than you've ever been, well you know
When the tides they pull you out
When the tides they pull you out
Out so far, Lord teach me how to swim, how to swim
Stay away from the bad tides
Only go where there's good vibes

The good vibes, I knew I would choose positivity
But still I realize my life is so much more
I know this life ain't what you bargained for
But honestly you never know what life has got in store
Cause everybody's gonna make it if they try
You persevere through your fears, never.
Fold your hands in a prayer to the sky
And let your worries wash away with the tides
And I'm singing

Now you've hit rock bottom and you're feeling lost at sea
Just keep your head above the water
And I know you'll find some way to breathe
When the tides they drag you down
When the tides they drag you down
Down under, wetter than you've ever been, well you know
When the tides they pull you out
When the tides they pull you out
Out so far, Lord teach me how to swim, how to swim
Stay away from the bad tides
Only go where there's good vibes

And you got to keep your chin up, keep your head held high
Just forget about the bad tides, let em roll on by
And you got to keep your chin up, keep your head held high
Just forget about the bad tides, let em roll on by

When the tides they drag you down
When the tides they drag you down
Down under, wetter than you've ever been, well you know
When the tides they pull you out
When the tides they pull you out
Out so far, Lord teach me how to swim, how to swim
Stay away from the bad tides
Only go where there's good vibes
Stay away from the bad tides
Only go where there's good vibes
