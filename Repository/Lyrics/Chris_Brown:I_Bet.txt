I Bet 
Chris Brown

[Hook]
Shawty wanna leave with a nigga, I bet
Cuz she wanna be on tv with a nigga, I bet
Bet you never thought that she would cheat on you, nigga, I bet
Don't be mad at me I pull that chopper out and squeeze on you niggas
No sympathy for you niggas

[Verse 1]
Oh shut the fuck up, miss me with the bullshits
Balling like a bitch, all my niggas hood rich
Bring some bitches to the crib, show 'em what the wood is
Your bitch look like shanayay, oh my goodness
It's five hundred, that be the block
Then you see that ghetto bird when you hear the shots
Where the plug at? Tell âem meet me at the docks
Sent the little homie through, might be the cops
Hold up Iâm gettingâ money boy your girl want me cuz I got âem toys
Rari's and the Bentleys and the bender doors
Double dicker buses and them private jets I spend it on
Painted on the Maserati, look like it been shitted on
Make her lift her skirt up, if she nervous I'm a pervert
I be in the pussy deep, a nigga fucking up her cervex
Leave the condoms on the bed, man, I do that shit on purpose
Cuz I hope a nigga see it when he comin' home from work

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I got a hunit on it
She ain't faithful to you, nigga
Run around town, you know thoughts get around
Nah, she testify, wouldn't trust her, homie
I gave her fuck what you know, makes no sense you hoer
Rolls gas pedals, Pockets on roseo
Rosetta, my stones ain't meant for the home, bitch
So comfortable (now get your ass off my couch, bitch)
Bounce shit, mouth shit, put in your mouth shit
I've been playin' with the pussy, time to put that thing in
Bang it, I'm banging, my binger âbout safety
I'm slayin', she chased it, she swallowed, she wasted
Fucking amazing, pump out that bass like free basin'
It's about a demonstration, the mileage, replace it
Come again, I replay it, speed it up, I'm speed racer
Better if you catch her line, she gonna reverse it cuz

[Hook]
I bet your bitch would be ready when I said Iâm fine to leave
We all fuck with fine Ferrari, hoers and the keys
Youâll be that nigga that she call over when she need someone to love
Iâll be that nigga witch is ball out for
After this struggling I be nothin' in her mouth like this
And you come home like, honey, I'm home, come and give me kiss
It's not a thing for me, really not a thing for me
We from different sets, why your bitch wanna bang with me?
All the time, all the time, I be on the grind
Hoes lookinâ me, the dollar signs run across they mind
It's the paper, they know a nigga get it, get it
Shawty gone be with it, let a nigga get it, hold up in it

[Hook]
