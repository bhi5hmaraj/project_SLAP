The Energy Never Dies 
The Script

24/7 baby, 365
We could all be blown to pieces
Because time's a ticking bomb
We can't all be dead tomorrow
But our love will carry on

Cause when you know your days are numbered
And you're looking in my eyes
It's not the end
Cause the energy never dies
Cause the energy never dies
