Wandering Star 
Empire Of The Sun

[Intro]
[?]
What I see in you
I remember too [?]
Never stopped
Looking now at you
What I really do
I will still call you
To leave me now

[Verse 1]
Don't you know when you crossed my path
Felt like fate
Don't you give up what we've got
Fate don't fade
Got locked [?] into the past
Retrieve everything

[Bridge]
Wandering stars might fade away, but you
Know that the Sun is here to stay
I'll be the one to tell you
Cause you walk the line
Between sugar and divine
My sweet diamond

[Verse 2]
I'm afraid of who
I may discover
If I look too long at myself

Staying on the move
In another time
All the traces of
You haunt me now

[Bridge]
Wandering stars might fade away, but you
Know that the Sun is here to stay
I'll be the one to tell you
Cause you walk the line
Between sugar and divine
My sweet diamond

[Chorus] x2
Never forget that avenue
Summer wept [?] in love with you (Never Forget)
Since you caught my heat on you [?]
Feel the streets that led me to (Never Forget)

[Break]
Am I past the road
I'm straight arrow
How feel right now
Falling crown
In just a while
I'll be back in style
Way beyond the dunes
Towards the sun

[Bridge]
Wandering stars might fade away, but you
Know that the Sun is here to stay
I'll be the one to tell you
Cause you walk the line
Between sugar and divine
My sweet diamond

[Chorus x4]
Never forget that avenue
Summer wept [?] in love with you (Never Forget)
Since you caught my heat on you [?]
Feel the streets that led me to (Never Forget)
