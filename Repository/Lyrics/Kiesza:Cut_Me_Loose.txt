Cut Me Loose 
Kiesza

[Verse:]
So this is what it is
I'm just another kiss
After you swore to me
Now I can truly see

[Pre-Chorus:]
I should of known when you came to me
I had eyes on a treasure I couldn't truly keep
Got so buried in love I cold hardly breathe
Fed you all of my heart and swallowed me
Now I'm starving

[Chorus:]
Stop wasting your time babe
No more changing your mind, I'll leave
Cut me loose
Do it for my sake
I'll be better on my own
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
I'm breaking the silence
It's time I do what's best for me
Cut me loose
And try to forget me
I'll be better own my own, on my own
I'll be better own my own, on my own

[Verse 2:]
How did it all begin
Maybe I'm caving in
Nothing I know is clear
Where do I go from here

[Pre-Chorus:]
I should of known when you came to me
I had eyes on a treasure I couldn't truly keep
Got so buried in love I cold hardly breathe
Fed you all of my heart and swallowed me
Now I'm starving

[Chorus:]
Stop wasting your time babe
No more changing your mind, I'll leave
Cut me loose
Do it for my sake
I'll be better on my own
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
I'm breaking the silence
It's time I do what's best for me
Cut me loose
And try to forget me
I'll be better own my own, on my own
I'll be better own my own, on my own

[Verse 3:]
[?] and give it my best not to fret
As I go on
Cause I don't want even a breathe of your sadness
To hope on
Take nothing more, I got no more to waist
Moving forward, there's too much to face
But I know that it's my only way

[Chorus:]
Stop wasting your time babe
No more changing your mind, I'll leave
Cut me loose
Do it for my sake
I'll be better on my own
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
I'm breaking the silence
It's time I do what's best for me
Cut me loose
And try to forget me
I'll be better own my own, on my own
I'll be better own my own, on my own
