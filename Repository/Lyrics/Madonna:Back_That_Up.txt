Back That Up 
Madonna

Sleep on the rhythm
Back that up
To the beat
To the beat
Back that up
To the beat
To the beat
Back that up
To the beat
To the beat

Do it, do it
Do it, do it
Let this party go
I'll be ready boy
Move to the rhythm
Slip to the rhythm
Back that up
To the beat
To the beat
Back that up
To the beat
To the beat
Back that up
To the beat
To the beat

Do it, do it
Do it, do it
I'll be drinking sometimes when I'm lost
I'll be wearing diamond, pearls
Sometimes I can be extreme
I'll never gonna stop
Keep this party going
âtil we going
âtil we drop

Don't remember us
Move to the beat of the drum
Sway to the minimum

Back that up
To the beat
To the beat
Back that up
To the beat
To the beat
Bang that drum to the beat
To the beat
Back that up
To the beat
To the beat

Do it, do it
Do it, do it
I'll be drinking sometimes when I'm lost
I'll be wearing diamond, pearls
Sometimes I can be extreme
I'll never gonna stop
Keep this party going
We'll be dancing

Bang that drum
To the beat
To the beat
Back that up
To the beat
To the beat
Bang that drum
To the beat
To the beat

Do it, do it
Do it, do it
Do it, do it
Do it, do it
Do it, do it
Do it, do it
