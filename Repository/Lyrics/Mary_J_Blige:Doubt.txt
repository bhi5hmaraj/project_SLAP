Doubt 
Mary J Blige

[Verse 1]
They said I'd never be a leader
They said I'd never wear a crown
If I wanted to be someone
I should learn to settle down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You should know better
I tell myself
You'll never go further
I warned myself
You'll never be better
Don't know me that well

[Chorus 1]
I made it to the end
I nearly paid the cost
I lost a lot of friends
I sacrificed a lot
I'd do it all again
Cause I made it to the top
But I can't keep doubting myself anymore

[Verse 2]
Now you're looking at a leader
Now you're staring at a queen
You'd said I'd never be someone
But now I'm pulling those strings

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You should know better
Won't make me back down
You'll never go further
Can't turn me around
You'll never be better
So no stopping me now

[Chorus 2]
I made it to the end
I nearly paid the cost
I lost a lot of friends
I sacrificed a lot
I'd do it all again
Cause I made it to the top
I can't keep doubting myself anymore

[Bridge]
You think you know
But you don't know the half
You think you beat me down
But I'll have the last laugh
I'll keep getting up
Cause that's what I want to do
I'm gonna be the best me
I'm sorry if it kills you

[Chorus 2]
I made it to the end
I nearly paid the cost
I lost a lot of friends
I sacrificed a lot
I'd do it all again
Cause I made it to the top
I can't keep doubting myself anymore

[Spoken Verse: Sam Smith]
And I remember holding The Breakthrough album
Holding it in my hands, in my car
Listening to it on repeat
To me she was this untouchable goddess
And, and when I met her
I really, really wasn't expecting her
To just be, like me
I feel like we're, we're so similar
