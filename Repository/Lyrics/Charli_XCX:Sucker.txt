Sucker 
Charli XCX

[Chorus]:
You said you wanna bang
Well, fuck you, sucker!

[Verse 1]
Head bang (bang), pink rocks (rocks)
Gold fangs (flexing), shit hot
Brick walls, don't stop
My hands, fresh cuts (sick)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh dear God, do you get me now, do you get me now, oh, you do?
Wow, you're awesome
Oh dear God, I'm a killer now, I'm a killer now, so are you
Wow you're awesome

[Chorus] (2x)

[Verse 2]
Invites, non-stop
Bleached out (fuck it), blue yachts
You joined my club
Luke loves (love it), your stuff (sick)

[Pre-Chorus - Variation]:
Oh dear God, do you get me now, do you get me now, oh, you do?
Wow you're awesome
Oh dear God, I'm a killer now, I'm a killer now (killer now, killer now, killer
now)

[Chorus] (x2)

[Bridge]
Sitting on a plastic speedboat
In the ultraviolet ocean
Playing cool songs
Trying to show off
Wow you're awesome
Wow you're awesome

[Outro]
Bang, bang
Bang, bang
Bang, bang
I'm a killer
Fuck you! Sucker!
Sucker!
Sucker!
Sucker!
Fuck you!
