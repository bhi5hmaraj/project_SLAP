Mistletoe 
Lucy Hale

The snow's piled up outside the door
The weather man says it's best to stay inside tonight
The mercury's falling, the streets lights are shiver
You know to let you go wouldn't be right
It's the last week of December, so let's out this snow together

If the power goes out, I got some candles in the drawer
If the heat goes down, I'll build a fire to keep us warm
I thought, I thought of everything I'd need
Oh I, just hope we don't run out of mistletoe, oh

Tinsel tree is shining bright
You look good in those twinkling lights
White Christmas playing, Billy Crosby singing
You know to let you go wouldn't be right
This year I might get my wish
'Cause there's only one thing on my list

If the pipes they freeze, I'll open a bottle of wine
And if we can't leave, we'll need a way to pass the time
I thought, I thought of everything I'd need
Oh I, just hope we don't run out of mistletoe, oh

If the power goes out
If the heat goes down, I'll build a fire to keep us warm
If the pipes they freeze, I'll open a bottle of wine
And if we can't leave, we'll need a way to pass the time
I thought, I thought of everything I'd need
Oh I, just hope we don't run out of mistletoe, oh
