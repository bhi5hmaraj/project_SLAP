If My Truck Could Talk 
Jason Aldean

[Verse:]
Twelve gauge, old Ford, buckshot floorboard, don't ask
Fence post, door dent, let's just leave it at that
It's got dirt on me, yeah I'd be up a tree

[Chorus:]
If my truck could talk, I'd have to yank out all the wires
Pour on the gas, set it on fire, anything to shut it up
It's been good to me but it knows too much, he'd sing it all
I'd have to find a riverbank and roll it off
If my truck could talk

[Verse 2:]
Those two headlights, looked in her eyes, how she danced
Moonlit truck bed, two kids, enough said, yeah man
All that went on, goes on my own
It can go on and on and on

[Chorus:]
If my truck could talk, I'd have to yank out all the wires
Pour on the gas, set it on fire, anything to shut it up
It's been good to me but it knows too much, he'd sing it all
I'd have to find a riverbank and roll it off
If my truck could talk

[Outro:]
If my truck could talk I couldn't deny a word it said
I'd just smile and shake my head, yeah

It's been good to me but it knows too much, he'd sing it all
I'd have to find a riverbank and roll it off
If my truck could talk, if my truck could talk
If my truck could talk
