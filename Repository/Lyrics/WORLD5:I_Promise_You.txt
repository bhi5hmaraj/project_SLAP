I Promise You 
WORLD5

Here we go again, the same old thing again
There always seems to be a problem
Why can't we work it out, why won't you let me in
You know together we can solve it
Don't walk away from me now
We need to talk about it
We have to save this love somehow
We can't live without it

Whatever our problems may be
It still comes down to you and me
I said I'd give you a lifetime
I promised you

Do you remember when
We were the best of friends
And everything came so easily
Now something's changed
We're on a different page
How can you say that you would leave me
After all that we've been through
How can we let this happen
Forever is more than just a word
And love is more than passion

Whatever our problems may be
It still comes down to you and me
I said I'd give you a lifetime
I promised you
