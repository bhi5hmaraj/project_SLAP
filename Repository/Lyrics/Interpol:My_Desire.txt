My Desire 
Interpol

[Verse:]
Be my desire
I'm a frustrated man
Summon us for peace
Do what we can

[Verse 2:]
Feel my desire
Favor the bold
Some of us fall to the Earth
These others roam
Beseeched by desire

[Chorus:]
Come on baby
You played me out
You played me out
That looked like your chance to me
But you played me out
So now I gave you up
It's time for a change of heart

[Verse 3:]
See my desire
No solemn moods
All of us are teammates
We stick to the rules
It's a real life desire

[Chorus 2:]
Come on baby
You played me out
You laid me out
That looked like your chance to me
But you played me out
So now I gave you up
It's time for a change of heart

[Bridge:]
I've been there
I feel you
Erased

[Verse 4:]
Be my desire
I'm a frustrated man
Some of us fell to the Earth
These others ran
They flee my desire

[Chorus 3:]
Come on baby
You played me out
You played me out
So it's time for a change of heart
You played me out
So I gave you up
You won't find no scars on me

[Outro:]
I've been there
I feel you
Erased

I've been there
I feel you
Erased
