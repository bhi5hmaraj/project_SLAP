Title 
Meghan Trainor

If you want my love
He gotta do what he does
If you want these sweet like sugar Gucci lips
He gotta give it up
I know you think I'm cool
But I ain't one of the boys
No, don't be scared that I'm gon' tie you down
I need a little more

[Chorus:]
Baby, don't call me your friend
If I hear that word again
You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed
And I know girls ain't hard to find
But if you think you wanna try
Then consider this an invitation to kiss my ass goodbye

[Reprise:]
Give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title
Better give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title

If it ain't no thang
I won't be hanging around
But don't blow up my shit at 3 am saying, "How you need me now?"
Don't call me boo
Like you're some kind of ghost
If you don't want me seeing other guys
Well, here's what you need to know

[Chorus:]
Baby, don't call me your friend
If I hear that word again
You might never get a chance to see me naked in your bed
And I know girls ain't hard to find
But if you think you wanna try
Then consider this an invitation to kiss my ass goodbye

[Reprise:]
Give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title
Better give me that title, title
Come on give me that title, title

You said I'm a special kind of woman
I'm loving what you got, but I'm hating what you doing
Gotta understand that I'm looking for a man who can get up on a bike, look ma,
no hands
You gotta show me off, off
But you embarrassed, if that's the case I'm all gone
You gotta treat me like a trophy, put me on the shelf
Or call me something else
