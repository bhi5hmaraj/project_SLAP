Don't Stop 
5 Seconds Of Summer

[Verse:]
You're like perfection
Some kind of holiday
You got me thinking
That we can run away
You want I'll take you there
You tell me when and where oh, oh oh oh

But then I
Asked for your number
Said you don't have a phone
It's getting late now
I gotta let you know

[Hook:]

That everybody wants to take you home tonight
But I'm gonna find a way to make you mine

[Chorus:]

Don't stop
Doin' what you're doin'
Every time you move to the beat
It gets harder for me and you
Know it, know it, know it

And don't stop
Cause you know that I like it
Every time you walk in the room you got all eyes on you and you
Know it, know it, know it

[Verse 2:]

You come in close now
Swear I can taste it
You got me tongue tied
I can't escape it
I'm loving what you got
But then you push me off oh, oh oh oh

[Hook:]

And everybody wants to take you home tonight
But I'm gonna find a way to make you mine

[Chorus:]

Don't stop
Doin' what you're doin'
Cause every time you move to the beat
It gets harder for me and you
Know it, know it, know it

Don't stop
Cause you know that I like it
Every time you walk in the room you got
All eyes on you and you
Know it, know it, know it

[Bridge:]

Everyday it's the same love and games that you play
Back and forth, round and round kinda like this way

[Chorus:]

Don't stop
Doin' what you're doin'
Cause every time you move to the beat
It gets harder for me and you
Know it, know it, know it

Don't stop
Cause you know that I like it
Every time you walk in the room you got
All eyes on you and you
Know it, know it, know it, know it

Don't stop
Don't stop, stop what you're doing
Cause you know that, you that I like it
Every time you move to the beat
It get's harder for me and you
Know it, know it, know it

Don't stop
Cause you know that I like it (you know that I like it)
Every time you walk in the room you got
All eyes on you and you
Know it, know it, know it
