While The Song Remains The Same 
Noel Gallagher

1, 2, 3, 4
Hold that not gonna let me go
We can dance believ the fly will flies on emptiness
It's ashame her memory fades to grace
We get love and get lost and we chasing yesterday
Find me a place where the sunshine's throw the rain
Find me a pleasure in the pain
While the song's remains the same
Ready go wild, on and on
Taking me down to the town where I was born
Cuz sometime can be a stranger be miles from home
We can hide by your lonely window page
You can walk the streets mile on a misterious way
Find me a place that sets out to the rain
Find me the pleasure in the pain
While te sing remains the same
Then it go on and on and on
Hold that hard, don't let me go
We can dance believ the fly will flies on emptiness
