Timber 
Pitbull

[Hook: Ke$ha]
It's going down, I'm yelling timber.
You better move, you better dance.
Let's make a night you won't remember.
I'll be the one you won't forget.

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
These bigiddy boys, are diggidy dogs.
I have 'em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off,
Twerkin in their bras and thongs. (Timber)
Face down. booty up. (Timber)
That's the way we like to what (Timber)
I'm slicker than an oil spill.
She say she won't, but I bet she will. (Timber)

[Pre-hook: Pitbull (x2)]
Swing your partner round and round.
End of the night, it's goin' down.
One more shot, another round.
End of the night, it's goin' down.

[Hook: Ke$ha (x2)]
It's going down, I'm yelling timber.
You better move, you better dance.
Let's make a night you won't remember.
I'll be the one you won't forget.

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird it's a plane.
Nah it's just me ain't a damn thing changed
Live in hotels, swing on planes.
Blessed to say, money ain't a thing.
Club jumpin' like LeBron now. (Voli)
Order me another round. (Homie)
We about to clown - why?
Cause it's about to go down.

[Pre-hook: Pitbull (x2)]
Swing your partner round and round.
End of the night, it's goin' down.
One more shot, another round.
End of the night, it's goin' down.

[Hook: Ke$ha (x2)]
It's going down, I'm yelling timber.
You better move, you better dance.
Let's make a night you won't remember.
I'll be the one you won't forget.
