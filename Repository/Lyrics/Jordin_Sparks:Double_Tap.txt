Double Tap 
Jordin Sparks

[Verse 1:]
Feeling like I got to get all this off my chest
I know you sitting there thinking "What she going do next?"
Crazy thinking back to the last text that you sent
Crazy like all these bitches, crazy like all these bitches
Remember I deleted all my other guys' numbers out my phone for ya?
Remember when you broke your neck and I had to wash your back for you? Ugh
You probably don't remember half the shit that I did for you (Yeah)

[Chorus:]
You didn't really f*** with me way back then, but how bout now?
'Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
You thought you had it all figured it out but, boy, how bout now?
'Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
You thought that the little love you put in was enough, but how bout now?
Boy, how bout now?
How bout now?
How bout now?
What about now, boy?
How bout now?

[Verse 2:]
Always been mommy's little angel
Then, once you blew up, head got big and you started changing (What?)
Can't believe all the things that you started saying
Like I'm with you for your fame and your name (What?)
That thought and your feature now setting up the game (What?)
She's dying to be is the famous
Asking for the things that you gave me
Try to lock you in with a baby (Ooh! )
Keeping it real, but no, I'm not acting shady
Blowing my phone, calling complaining, boy, you tried to once but heard

[Chorus:]
You didn't really f*** with me way back then, but how bout now?
'Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
You thought you had it all figured it out but, boy, how bout now?
'Cause I'm up right now and you suck right now
You thought that the little love you put in was enough, but how bout now?
Boy, how bout now?
How bout now?
How bout now?
What about now, boy?
How bout now?
