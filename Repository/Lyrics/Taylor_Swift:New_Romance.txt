New Romance 
Taylor Swift

[Verse:]
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a class room

[Chorus:]
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
We're the new romantics
Come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We're too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Verse 2:]
We're all here the lights and boy are blinding
We hang back its all in the timing
It's poker, you can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace
We need love but all we want is danger
We team up and switch up like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey most of them are true

[Chorus:]
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
We're the new romantics
Come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We're too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic, so romantic

[Chorus:]
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
We're the new romantics
Come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We're too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Chorus:]
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
We're the new romantics
Come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We're too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free
