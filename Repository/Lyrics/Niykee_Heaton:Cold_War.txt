Cold War 
Niykee Heaton

[Intro]
Baby I just wanna thank you
Baby I just wanna thank you

[Verse 1]
Those nights you took her home
Press "decline" on your phone
Left me crying all alone
You chose, you chose
To let me lie there on your sheets
You told me things that you don't speak
Let me love you then you leave

[Refrain]
Baby I just wanna thank you
Baby I just wanna thank you

[Chorus]
Forfeit this cold war
It's not yours anymore
I'm done, I'm done
How rightly you want love
Tell me how to brink without your touch
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done

[Refrain]
Baby I just wanna thank you
Baby I just wanna thank you

[Verse 2]
Wanna thank you for that pain
How you branded me with shame
Made me hate my own mistakes
You made, you take
I should thank you for this time
Showed me how to stay alive
How to hurt and how to cry
You right, now I

[Refrain](2x)
Baby I just wanna thank you
Baby I just wanna thank you

[Chorus]
Forfeit this cold war
It's not yours anymore
I'm done, I'm done
How rightly you want love
Tell me how to brink without your touch
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done

[Bridge]
I just wanna thank you
I just want, I just want
I just wanna thank you

[Chorus](2x)
Forfeit this cold war
It's not yours anymore
I'm done, I'm done
How rightly you want love
Tell me how to brink without your touch
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done
