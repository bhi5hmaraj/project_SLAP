No Good In Goodbye 
The Script

[Verse 1:]
All the things that we have lost
Breaking up comes at a cost
I know I miss this mistake
Every word I try to choose
Either way Iâm gonna lose
Canât take the ache from heartbreak

[Pre-Chorus:]
But as you walk away
You donât hear me say

[Chorus:]
Whereâs the "good" in "goodbye"?
Whereâs the "nice" in "nice try"?
Whereâs the "us" in "trust" gone?
Whereâs the "soul" in "soldier on"?
Now Iâm the "low" in "lonely"
âCause I donât own you only
I can take this mistake but
I canât take the "ache" from "heart break"

[Verse 2:]
No matter how it falls apart
Thereâs an âartâ in "breaking hearts"
But thereâs no âfairâ in "farewell"
And when I see you in the street
I pray to God you donât see
The silent "hell" in "I wish you well"

[Pre-Chorus:]
But as you walk away
You donât hear me say

[Chorus:]
Whereâs the "good" in "goodbye"?
Whereâs the "nice" in "nice try"?
Whereâs the "us" in "trust" gone?
Whereâs the "soul" in "soldier on"?
Now Iâm the "low" in "lonely"
âCause I donât own you only
I can take this mistake but
I canât take the "ache" from "heart break"

[Bridge:]
If I could turn back time
Then I would rewrite those lines
If I could turn back time
I would rewrite those lines

[Chorus:]
Whereâs the "good" in "goodbye"?
Whereâs the "nice" in "nice try"?
Whereâs the "us" in "trust" gone?
Whereâs the "soul" in "soldier on"?
Now Iâm the "low" in "lonely"
âCause I donât own you only
I can take this mistake but
I canât take the "ache" from "heart break"

[Outro:]
If I could turn back time
Then I would rewrite those lines
