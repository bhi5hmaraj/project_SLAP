The Mexican 
Noel Gallagher

They say that you need love
Just like a kid on crack
I got a feeling of what you are
It's kind of holding me back

You say you can't feel the heat
Under the morning sun
I got a feeling what you are
My feet just been blown away all night

I thought I was talking about a new day legend
Waiting on the outside last in the fall
I was on dreaming of a revolution
Waiting for the right time
Watching decline

They say that you need love
Just like a kid on crack
I got a feeling of what you are
It's kind of holding me back


You say you can't feel the heat
Behind the setting sun
I got a feeling what you are
My feet just been blown away all night

I thought I was talking about a new day legend
Waiting on the outside last in the fall
I was on dreaming of a revolution
Waiting for the right time
Watching decline

I thought I was talking about a new day legend
Waiting on the outside last in the fall
I was on dreaming of a revolution
Waiting for the right time
Watching decline

I thought I was talking about a new day legend
Waiting on the outside last in the fall
I was on dreaming of a revolution
Waiting for the right time
Watching decline
