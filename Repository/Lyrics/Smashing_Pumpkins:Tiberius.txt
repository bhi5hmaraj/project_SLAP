[Verse:]
Hush my love, don't bite
Never leave here this night
Words break, don't faint
What is love if love obeys
Let flee doves in flight
Make me stray from my light
Never leave here softly

[Chorus:]
I've seen the world upon a thousand dreams
Your eyes are one that can't see what it means
But still I love you
Like everything, it goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes

[Verse 2:]
If you break, believe me
If you take, deceive me
To the sound of one clapping hand
Is your heart so lonely
That your honor is only
As good as can be had on command
Hush my love, don't fight
Never leave here this night

[Chorus:]
I've seen the world upon a thousand dreams
Your eyes are one that can't see what it means
But still I love you
Like everything, it goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes

[Refrain]
I've seen the world upon a thousand trees
I've seen the world upon a thousand trees
It goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes and goes
It goes
