What Is What 
Interpol

[Verse:]
Why don't you see it? Why don't you feel me?
I won't repeat it, the [?] eats me
Stable, spatial
I thought you'd seek me, my company
I had to get through those eyes to see that world complete
That world comes to me

[Chorus:]
I can show you what is what
I can show you how it operates
Now that I know you, I can show you how it works.

[Verse 2:]
I saw you speak and I don't believe
The [?] I'm at the beach with Jane
Cause Jane, I can lean on
You've got your secrets, your sovereignty
I want the [?] in your eyes to reflect on me
With no complications.

[Chorus:]
I can show you what is what
I can show you how it operates
Now that I know you, I can show you how it gets it over
I can show you what is what
I can show you how it gets it over.

[Bridge:]
This little tossing word
A ceasing in time, and the smiling
But that's all behind
Cause my world is peaceful
It's very kind
Silence [?] comes to me.

Now that I know you, I can show you what is what
Now that I know you, I can show you how it gets it over
Now, letting go, I can show you how it works.

[Chorus:]
