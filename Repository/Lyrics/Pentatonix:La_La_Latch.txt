La La Latch 
Pentatonix

You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found

Hush, don't speak
When you spit your venom,
Keep it shut I hate it
When you hiss and preach
About your new messiah
Cause your theories catch fire

I can't find your silver lining
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech, it's tiring
Enough is enough

Covering my ears like a kid
Where in your words mean nothing I go la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
If my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it
I go la la, la la la la la la

I'm so en-captured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it? You got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart bleed out my chest?

Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you (never let go, I won't let go)

I can't find your silver lining
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech, it's tiring
Enough is enough

Covering my ears like a kid
And I'm latching onto you la la la la
I'm turning up the volume when you speak
If my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it
I go la la, la la la la la la
Latching onto la la, la la la la la la la
Never, la la, la la la la la la la la la
