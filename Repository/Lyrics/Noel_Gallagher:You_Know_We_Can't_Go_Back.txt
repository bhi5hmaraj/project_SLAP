You Know We Can't Go Back 
Noel Gallagher

[Verse 1]
Danger time will felt like I lost my way
I was stayed in silence, in silence and see this all
With my hand on my heart I could tell you if I was dreamin'
Take you tothe love on walls
I won't wake up this time

[Hook]
Baby I believe in magic love
Find the morning stars above
I take you from one stars on and you'll bring you down
And I love you for all time
But it's alright to know we can't go back
Said it's alright to know we can't go back
Know we can't go back

[Verse 1]
Yeah that's the time that I guess I must believe in
Done out things and we scream out loud
With my hand on my heart I could tell I just be heavy
Take me to the love and dawn cuz I won't back down this time

[Hook]

Said it's alright to know we can't go back x 3
