Lighthouse 
GRL

[Verse 1]
When it gets real, just know that I'll be there
I got your back, like it's just you and me here
I'll go to war for you, let them bring it
I'll take on the world for you, better believe it

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you need me, just holla my name
We ain't never scared, no we're not afraid
Whenever, whatever, know I'm down for life
I'm your ride or die

[Chorus]
When the night gets cold and the lights go out
The sun is gone behind the clouds
And you feel lost, and I'll reach out
To guide you home with my lighthouse

[Hook]
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
I'll guide you home with my lighthouse
Oh whoa, ooh whoa
I'll guide you home...

[Verse 2]
Whenever you're down, I'll lift you up
People gon' hate, let them hate on us
I move in too strong, I click too deep
'Cause I got you, and you got me

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you need me, just holla my name
We ain't never scared, no we're not afraid
Whenever, whatever, know I'm down for life
I'm your ride or die

[Chorus]
When the night gets cold and the lights go out
The sun is gone behind the clouds
And you feel lost, and I'll reach out
To guide you home with my lighthouse

[Hook]
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
I'll guide you home with my lighthouse
Oh whoa, ooh whoa
I'll guide you home...

[Bridge]
If you ever need me, know I'll be there
Don't you ever be afraid to call
I'll be waitin' over the horizon
Don't you worry, I'm not very far

I'll light it up, show you the way
I'll light it up, show you the way
I'll light it up, show you the way
I'll light it up, don't be afraid!

[Chorus x2]
When the night gets cold and the lights go out
The sun is gone behind the clouds
And you feel lost, and I'll reach out
To guide you home with my lighthouse

[Hook]
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
I'll guide you home with my lighthouse
Oh whoa, ooh whoa
I'll guide you home...
