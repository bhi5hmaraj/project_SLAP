FourFiveSeconds
Rihanna and Kanye West and Paul McCartney

Rihanna
I think I've had enough, I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind, I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness is taken for weakness

Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days till Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Kanye West
Woke up an optimist, sun was shining, I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back I'm 'bout to spaz

Both
Yeah, I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days till Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try it
Ooh, that's all I want

Rihanna
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so selfish?"
But you called bout a thousand times wondering where I been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize, I hope you can understand

Kanye West
If I go to jail tonight, promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride, but that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness is taken for weakness

Both
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days till Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want

Four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days till Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
'Cause that's all I want
