Caught On Fire 
Rita Ora

[Verse 1]
I wish I could see, understand what you think
I would piece it all together
I wish I can know, and I wish I can hold
Every single photograph
It's hard to believe, how the chemical feeds
Keeps spilling us both together
If the image is froze in the digital snow
Then I can't find my way back
Hold on to that
Hold on
And

[Chorus]
I can't escape
I can't look away
There's something inside It's caught on fire
Me and you're to blame
I see in your eyes
Cause you're taking your time
The closer you get I'm taken by desire
Caught on fire
Caught on fire

[Verse 2]
And now in the heat, I can finally see
That I'm wrapped around your finger
Lost in the game, caught in the flame
Cause you can always pull me in
And there was a time you were not on my mind
But the world I can't remember
The meter is red, close to the edge
But you know that

[Chorus]
I can't escape
I can't look away
There's something inside It's caught on fire
Me and you're to blame
I see in your eyes
Cause you're taking your time
The closer you get I'm taken by desire
Caught on fire
Caught on fire

[Bridge]
Hold on, give in
Don't let this go tonight
Hold on
Caught on fire

[Chorus]
I can't escape
I can't look away
There's something inside It's caught on fire
Me and you're to blame
I see in your eyes
Cause you're taking your time
The closer you get I'm taken by desire
Caught on fire
Caught on fire
