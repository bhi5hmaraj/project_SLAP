Chains 
Nick Jonas

[Verse 1]
With her wine-stained lips, yeah she's nothing but trouble
Cold to the touch but she's warm as a devil
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
She tasted her break and I can't get more

[Chorus]
You got me in chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn't change, no I wouldn't change this love
You got me chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn't change, no I wouldn't change this love

[Bridge]
Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me

{Verse 2]
Alone in the night âtil she knocks on my door
Oh no, wasted again but I can't say no (no)
Baby tell me why, why you do, do me wrong
Baby tell me why, why you do, do me wrong
Gave you my heart but you took my soul

[Chorus]
You got me in chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn't change, no I wouldn't change this love
You got me chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn't change, no I wouldn't change this love

[Bridge]
Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me

[Refrain]
Baby tell me why, why you do, do me wrong
Baby tell me why, why you do, do me wrong
Gave you my heart but you took my soul

[Chorus]
You got me in chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn't change, no I wouldn't change this love
You got me chains, you got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn't change, no I wouldn't change this love

[Outro]
Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me
