This Is Not A Game 
Chemical Brothers

[Intro: Lorde]
There it is

[Verse 1: Miguel]
Find what you love and let it kill you
Chop under pressure, thinkin' dammit
All eyes on me like a conductor
That mean, just play your role, you might can chime in
Wait!
Play the game to change the game
Word to Gucci, that's my hitta
Your way is livin' in the moment, huh?
My way is livin' for tomorrow

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Wonder
What I'm doin'
Yeah I know what I'm doin'
Say I know what I'm doin'
I'm talkin' 'bout a revolution

[Chorus: Both]
There it is
Wait
Nah babe
There it is
Wait
Nah babe
There it is

[Verse 2: Miguel]
All around the clock
Even when I'm under fire, preach
I'll never settle, I'll just stop 'em boy
But I ain't [?]

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Wonder
What I'm doin'
Yeah I know what I'm doin'
Say I know what I'm doin'
I'm talkin' 'bout a revolution

[Chorus: Both]
There it is
Wait
Nah babe
There it is
Wait
Nah babe
There it is

[Interlude]
No this is not a game
No this is not a game
No this is not a game

[Bridge:]
Patience and determination
Starin' at a body of it
Starin' at a gladiator
Victory is sweet and I'ma get it now and later

Wonder
What I'm doin'
Patience and determination
Yeah I know what I'm doin' baby
Starin' at a gladiator
Yeah I know what I'm doin' baby
Say I know what I'm doin'
Starin' at a gladiator
I'm talkin' 'bout a revolution

[Verse 3: Miguel]
No this is not a game, nah babe
I'm talkin' turn out
I won't ever burn out
What I gotta make it turn out

No this is not a game, nah babe
I'm talkin' turn out
I won't ever burn out
What I gotta make it turn out

[Outro: Lorde]
There it is
There it is
