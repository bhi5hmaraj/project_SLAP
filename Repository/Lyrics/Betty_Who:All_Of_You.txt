All Of You 
Betty Who

[Verse 1]
It's a perfect day for a fight
Running after me in the pouring rain
Screaming: "Baby you were right
I need you, I need you"
Calling my name is a twisted game
Cause it wears me down till I love you more
Waking up to us making up makes it better than before

[Chorus]
Ohhh, wind me up tight, convertible nights with you
Ohhh, I'll give you romance, a hundred last chances too
Sometimes you make it impossible
But I wanna go and get lost with you, my love
I want you to give me all of you

[Verse 2]
Get to know me, in your backseat
Drive me crazy, then you drive me home
The only place I wanna be
Is with you, is with you
Trying my luck when I work you off
Throwing all your clothes off the second floor
Waking up to us, making up makes it better than before

[Chorus]
Ohhh, wind me up tight, convertible nights with you
Ohhh, I'll give you romance, a hundred last chances too
Sometimes you make it impossible
But I wanna go and get lost with you, my love
I want you to give me all of you

[Bridge]
It's a perfect day for a fight
Running after me in the pouring rain

[Chorus]
Ohhh, wind me up tight, convertible nights with you
Ohhh, I'll give you romance, a hundred last chances too
Sometimes you make it impossible
But I wanna go and get lost with you, my love
I want you to give me all of you
