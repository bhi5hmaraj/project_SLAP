One Last Night 
Vaults

[Verse 1]
Tied to a sallow heart
Why does he want to bring me where he goes?
Oh and to find out the reasons why
It's enough to make you wanna try for one last night

[Verse 2]
Ghosts and silhouettes
They take a piece of me, they want it all
Oh but to wait in an empty room
With the feeling that it's closing in

[Chorus]
I had a dream I was dying
But I found nobody there
And if one last night is all that we've been given
Let's live it like we care
For one last night
For one last night

[Verse 3]
Broken upon the rocks
Let the beating waves come drag me down
Oh but to find out the reasons why
It's enough to make you wanna try for one last night

[Chorus]
I had a dream I was dying
But I found nobody there
And if one last night is all that we've been given
Let's live it like we care
For one last night
For one last night

For one last night
For one last night
For one last night
