Blue 
Marina And The Diamonds

[Verse 1]
We've broken up and now I regret it
I said goodbye when I shouldn't have said it
I even cried but I never meant it
And I don't know why but I can't forget it

[Pre-Chorus]
Gimme love, gimme dreams, gimme a good self esteem
Gimme good and pure, what you waiting for?
Gimme everything, all your heart can bring
Something good and true
I don't wanna feel blue anymore (blue)
I don't wanna feel blue anymore (blue)
Gimme, gimme

[Chorus]
Gimme one more night
One last goodbye
Let's do it one last time
Let's do it one last time
One more time

[Verse 2]
No, I don't love you
No, I don't care
I just want to be held when I'm scared
And all I want is one night with you
Just cause I'm selfish
I know it's true

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Gimme one more night
One last goodbye
Let's do it one last time
Let's do it one last time
One more time

[Bridge] (x2)
I'm sick of looking after you
I need a man to hold on to
I'm bored of everything we do
But I just keep coming back to you

[Chorus]
Gimme one more night
One last goodbye
Let's do it one last time
Let's do it one last time
One more time

[Outro]
Gimme love, gimme dreams
Gimme a good self esteem
Gimme good and pure, what you waiting for?
Gimme everything, all your heart can bring
Something good and true
I don't wanna feel blue anymore (blue)
I don't wanna feel blue anymore (blue)
Gimme, gimme, gimme anything
But blue, blue, blue, royal blue
I just wanna know who I'm looking for (blue)
Gimme, gimme, gimme anything but blue, blue, blue
