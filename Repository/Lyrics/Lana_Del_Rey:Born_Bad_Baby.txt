Born Bad Baby 
Lana Del Rey

[Intro]
I was born bad but then I met you
You made me nice for a while
But my dark side's true
You neva cared what I did at all
Motel singer or the silver ball
I did, but I had to [?]

[Verse 1]
Femme fatale, always on the run
Diamonds on the wrist, whiskey on my tongue
Before I'll be bad, I gotta get drunk
So get ova here, pour me a cold one

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby can see that I'm danger
[?] rolling off of the stage
Sparkling secrets, [?]
Turn to give in to the kindness of strangers

[Chorus X2]
PrÃ©cisÃ©ment, but I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My Daddy's in the trunk, papa's brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

[Verse 2]
[?] I know killin' someone
Get's a lil easier after telling puns
You know that I'm fine, you know that I'm young
So tell me your mind, let's get it on

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby can see that I'm danger
Glamorous, but I'm deranged
Dancing on top of the tables
A sinner and a mess, how can you be my savior?

[Chorus x2]
PrÃ©cisÃ©ment, but I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My Daddy's in the trunk, papa's brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

[Bridge]
I love you, my darling
You, darling You, darling
You, darling You, darling
Dancing on top of the tables
[?]
Shining so bright, [?]
I gotta get ya back, cuz I gotta [?]

[Chorus x2]
PrÃ©cisÃ©ment, but I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My Daddy's in the trunk, papa's brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck
