Dead Wrong 
Trey Songz

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You know you dead wrong
Up in the club, but you left your man home
You couldn't even wait till we got to the bedroom
I know it ain't good, but these hoes gon' do what they want, want

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Pull up in a Porsche, no rental
No key, now she on me
Know the star shit ****ing with your mental
Wanna be my tenderoni?
Now we chilling poolside for the night
Hollywood sign, I ain't caught up in the lights
Trigga baby, I'mma do you right
Don't make me have to tell you twice

[Bridge:]
I **** em all the time but you know I never wife em, uh
Real nigga no lie, man I swear these hoes triflin', uh
But I'mma give her what she like, beat it down like Tyson, uh
It's the pretty ones that you really need to keep your eye on

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You know you dead wrong
Up in the club, but you left your man home
You couldn't even wait till we got to the bedroom
I know it ain't good, but these hoes gon' do what they want, want

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I just left the show with a two piece
Dollar sign, got groupies
I'mma take her to the mother****ing hotel
Let her do her, then do me, oh
One bad light-skinned and an Asian
I'mma stack em up like Legos
She call me papi, ain't none of us Spanish
But I let her chupar mis huevos
We be ****ing all the time but she know I'll never wife her, nah
Had her in a feeling when she see me with my white girl, ah
She act square around a nigga but when she with me she like girls, ah
It's the pretty girls that you really need to keep your eye on, oh

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
Who am I to judge you?
I love you whenever you're near
Bring your body here
Right now, I'mma knock it right down
Say you got a nigga? Go figure
Take another sip of this liquor
Talk a little shit, got my **** much bigger
Baby, let me tell you a lil' something 'bout Trigga
