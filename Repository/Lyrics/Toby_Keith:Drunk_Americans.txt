Drunk Americans 
Toby Keith

We ain't East, we ain't West
We ain't left, we ain't right
We ain't black, we ain't white
We just came here to drink
We're all mud flops of bourbons
All bold caps and turbans
All prom queens and strippers
We're the whole kitchen skin
We're here, we're the same
Everyone knows your name

[Chorus:]
We just rise up our glass
We don't give a rat's ass
If you're a democrat or republican
We're happy to be here as much as you can see
We're all drunk Americans

We ain't second exploits,
We ain't cowboys or redskins
We ain't preachers or Indians
We just having fun
We're all in suits and blue colors
So dollars and long collars
Paper and plastic, to old and to young
Ceos, jds, twas, fbis, bsts

[Chorus:]
And we rise up our glass
We don't give a rat's ass
If you're belly's too fat or you're wallet is too thin
We're happy to be here as much as you can see
We're just all drunk Americans

All drunk Americans

We been in, we been out
We been cool, we been weird
Thank God we're still here
A man to the free
And we're all singin' wrong
But we all sing along
Sing along

[Chorus:]
We just rise up our glass
We don't give a rat's ass
If you're a democrat or republican
We're happy to be here as much as you can see
We're all just drunk Americans

It denies me a lot
When it starts with old straps
And We're all drunk Americans
