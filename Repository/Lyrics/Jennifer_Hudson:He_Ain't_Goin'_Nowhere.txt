He Ain't Goin' Nowhere 
Jennifer Hudson

You should listen to the
Your boyfriend say
Search high and lows at his dirty mind
The concentrate on again his heartbreak
Find your treasure, make it last forever
Now

Give thought you want in more pleasure
Leave no one, yâall come together
Whisper in his ear
It makes it hotter
Donât like the sweat
It makes it better
That heâll come brand new ones
Donât hit him the question
I smile off the dust
Trust me girl donât stress him

He ainât moving
He ainât going nowhere
He ainât moving
He ainât going nowhere
He ainât moving
He ainât going nowhere
He ainât moving
He ainât going nowhere

Give thought you want in more pleasure
Leave no one, yâall come together
Whisper in his ear
It makes it hotter
Donât like the sweat
It makes it better
That heâll come brand new ones
Donât hit him the question
I smile off the dust
Trust me girl donât stress him

He ainât moving
He ainât going nowhere
He ainât moving
He ainât going nowhere
He ainât moving
He ainât going nowhere
He ainât moving
He ainât going nowhere
