God Of War 
Nicole Scherzinger

Let's do this

God of war
God of war

These old tears, they're just liquid years
Of rivers filled with minimal joy
And this little pain, no gain, just rain
I strain to pull myself out of your hurt until today

I'm so glad you're going away
I'm sorry and sad to say

Tears of joy
Tears of joy

I'm so glad you're gone
You're so fucking annoying
You just don't know
I'm so excited you're gone
No more fighting back and forth
God of war

I'm not fair, I don't care
I can't wait for you to walk out of my door
Cause this ain't life
Ain't right under your knife
Can't cut my love anymore

I'm so glad you're going away
I'm sorry and sad to say

Tears of joy
Tears of joy

I'm so glad you're gone
You're so fucking annoying
You just don't know
I'm so excited you're gone
No more fighting back and forth
God of war

One day you'll wanna wash it, the ground I walk on
Oh you love the things that I know are gone
One day I'll wanna replay
The days that could have went right
But you made them so wrong
Concealing our face in the melodies of songs

God of war
God of war
