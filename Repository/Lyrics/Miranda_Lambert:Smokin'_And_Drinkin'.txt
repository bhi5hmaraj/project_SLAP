Smokin' And Drinkin' 
Miranda Lambert

It was one of those times what a real good time felt like a long time ago
It was one of those fires that burned all night and made your blue jeans smell
like smoke
Hanging with friends, going again start upbringing, smokin' and drinkin'
It was one of those girls and one of those guys who didn't know quite what to
do
We were going along with what was going on saying I think I love you
And I think about us now every time I go out, smokin' and drinkin'

Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' got cha thinkin about the one that got away
So here's to all those nights all we felt was life smokin' and drinkin'

We be lighting up saying this town sucks so we painted on the bridge
We were young in love to not know enough that those were the days that we were
going to miss
But damn we know it now cause that's all we talk about smokin' and drinkin'

Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' got cha thinkin about the one that got away
So here's to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin' and drinkin'

Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' got cha thinkin about the one that got away
So here's to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin' and drinkin'

Smokin' and drinkin' on the weekend like we did back in the day
Smokin' and drinkin' got cha thinkin about the one that got away
So here's to all those nights all we felt was life, smokin' and drinkin'
Woah Woah Woah Woah Woah Woah Woah Woah Woah
Smokin' and drinkin'
Woah Woah Woah
Woah Woah Woah Woah
Woah Woah Woah Woah Woah
Smokin' and drinkin'
