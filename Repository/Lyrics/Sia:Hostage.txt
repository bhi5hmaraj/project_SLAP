Hostage 
Sia

[Verse:]
You bring me to life
Then you shut me out
You keep me silent
When I should shout out
You make me cry when you make me come
You are the cop and I'm on the run

[Hook:]
It all begins
Just one kiss
I'm held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs
Lock me up
I'm held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough, but I can't get enough
This secret about us keeps being a ghost
Don't lock me up
Don't you wanna free us?
I'm held hostage by your love

[Verse 2:]
When you left me out
And I catch the sun
You give me a taste of you and no one
But you're always leaving, again I'm alone
This secret burns
But I'm imprisoned

[Hook:]
It all begins
Just one kiss
I'm held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs
Lock me up
I'm held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough, but I can't get enough
This secret about us keeps being a ghost
Don't lock me up
Don't you wanna free us?
I'm held hostage by your love

[Bridge:]
Secret life of lovers who have others
Under the covers
And while you break my heart
I'm a criminal in these parts

[Hook:]
It all begins
Just one kiss
I'm held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs
Lock me up
I'm held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough, but I can't get enough
This secret about us keeps being a ghost
Don't lock me up
Don't you wanna free us?
I'm held hostage by your love

[Hook:]
It all begins
Just one kiss
I'm held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs
Lock me up
I'm held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough, but I can't get enough
This secret about us keeps being a ghost
Don't lock me up
Don't you wanna free us?
I'm held hostage by your love
