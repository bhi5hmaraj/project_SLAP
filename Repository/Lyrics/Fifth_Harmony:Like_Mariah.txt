Like Mariah 
Fifth Harmony

[Verse 1]
Love it when you call me baby
When you lightin' up my phone
Makes me want you like I'm crazy
I'm running home, I'm running home
Just to hear your heart beat
You're so sweet like honeycomb
Got to have you near me
Cause you're the best I've ever known

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me get up, get up like this is my song
I'ma get up, get up, yeah, yeah
You got me humming, humming to the beat of the drum
To the rhythm, rhythm, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Your loving takes me higher
You set my heart on fire
When you touch my body got me singing like Mariah
There is no denying, your kisses keep me flying
When you touch by body got me singing like Mariah
Singing like Mariah

[Verse 2]
Your name is written on my lips
You're the only one for me
Every single litlle kiss
Is like a dream, is like a dream
I don't need to make a whish
Cause all I want is you
When you do it like this
I just lose my cool

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Uh, T-Raw on fire
If you're looking for that fly love, I'm your number one supplier
Wanna try it, buy it
You wanna ride with the hottest in the city, set your heart on fire
Yeah I do it it, I do it, do it, ain't nothin' to it
If you wit it, I know she wit it, so come and do it
Got that pretty, that pretty pretty
You're so sidity, like Aaliyah, Mariah Carey, you stay winning
Top down ridin', I'm Big Papa
She love when I fly it, Lambo pilot
Hop inside it, sit on my lap, angel body
I'm a King, need a Goddess, gotta love it

[Chorus]
