Bonfire Heart 
James Blunt

Verse 1:
Your mouth is a revolver firing bullets in the sky.
Your love is like a soldier, loyal till you die.
And Iâve been looking at the stars for a long, long time.
Iâve been putting out fires all my life.
Everybody wants a flame, but they donât want to get burnt.
And today is our turn.

Chorus:
Days like these lead to, nights like this leads to love like ours,
You light the spark in my bonfire heart.
People like us, we donât need that much.
Just someone that starts, starts the spark in our bonfire hearts.

Verse 2:
This world is getting colder. Strangers passing by.
No one offers you a shoulder. No one looks you in the eye.
But Iâve been looking at you for a long, long time.
Just trying to break through, trying to make you mine.
Everybody wants a flame, they donât want to get burnt
Well today is our turn.

Chorus:
Days like these lead to nights like this leads to love like ours,
You light a spark in my bonfire heart.
People like us, we donât need that much.
Just someone that starts, starts a spark in our bonfire hearts.

Outro:
Hmm, our bonfire hearts
our bonfire hearts
Uh, our bonfire hearts
You light the spark

People like us, we donât need that much.
Just someone that starts, starts a spark in our bonfire hearts.

Chorus:
Days like these lead to nights like this leads to love like ours,
You light a spark in my bonfire heart.
People like us, we donât need that much.
Just someone that starts, starts a spark in our bonfire hearts.
our bonfire hearts

Days like these lead to nights like this leads to love like ours,
You light a spark in my bonfire heart.
People like us, we donât need that much.
Just someone that starts, starts a spark in our bonfire hearts.

People like us, we donât need that much.
Just someone that starts, starts a spark in our bonfire hearts
