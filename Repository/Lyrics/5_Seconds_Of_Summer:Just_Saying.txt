Just Saying

[5 Seconds of Summer]
You've got a boyfriend
And he's a total loser
All your friends tell you that he's got not future
But they like me...
Just saying

He barely takes you out
If he does he's late
And when the check comes he always makes you pay
I'd never do that
Just saying

You should leave him
Cause it really makes me sick
Just saying
Just saying
You don't need him
I'll help you get over it
Just saying
Just saying


When you change your mind I'll be waiting
'Cause I'm better than him
Just saying
When you change your mind I'll be waiting

Got a big house says he lives alone
But when I drove by I could see his mom was home
I got my own place
Just saying
(He totally lies to you)
Just saying

He says he loves you
But it's all an act
He's someone else right behind your back
You know I'd never do that (he would never do that)
Just saying

You should leave him
Cause it really makes me sick
Just saying
Just saying
You don't need him
I'll help you get over it
Just saying

When you change your mind I'll be waiting
'Cause I'm better than him
