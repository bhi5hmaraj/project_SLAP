Piano 
Kiesza

[Verse:]
I still remember you
Had me like a picture frame
While staring in your eyes
My minds still in the memory

Talking like I'm bulletproof
My hearts playing Hunger Games
Knowing that when you and I, collide
I'll give you everything

[Pre-Chorus:]
When I try to run away, you make me bring it right back
And I don't think I've ever had a feeling like that
Oh? You're love is nonfiction? It's the realest I've seen
But you don't even know what you're doing to me

[Chorus:]
You, you, you're setting off a fuse
You make me wanna break the rules
Come put your hand on my piano

You, you, no you ain't got nothing to prove
You got me breaking all the rules
So put your hand on my piano

[Verse 2:]
[?], I don't wanna lose
[?] how you say my name
Acting like I'm in control, I fold
You're taking over me

Lost baby, here's the truth
I'm blindfolded in your maze
Body's glowing in the dark
And that's all that I ever need

[Pre-Chorus:]
When I try to run away, you make me bring it right back
And I don't think I've ever had a feeling like that
Oh? You're love is nonfiction? It's the realest I've seen
But you don't even know what you're doing to me

[Chorus:]
You, you, you're setting off a fuse
You make me wanna break the rules
Come put your hand on my piano

[Bridge:]
Looking for a way out, but I can't go
Cause babe, I even see you with my eyes close
Babe, I even see you with my eyes close

Looking for a reason but I've got none
Cause secretly I don't think I want one
Honestly, I don't think I want one

[Chorus:]
You, you, you're setting off a fuse
You make me wanna break the rules
Come put your hand on my piano

[Chorus:]
You, you, you're setting off a fuse
You make me wanna break the rules
Come put your hand on my piano
