Be Lucky 
Who

[Chorus: x3]
Be lucky
Be lucky
Be lucky, son

Be lucky gotta make it your own
Get from a bottle squeeze it from a stone
Might not remember the best way home
But come December you won't be alone

[Chorus: x3]
Be lucky
Be lucky
Be lucky, son

Be lucky, place your bet
Put it on a map, we ain't done nuthin' yet
Make sure it was born in the land-born hills
That Kentucky farm could pay your bills

You want to travel across great divide
You really gotta have some luck on your side
You want to climb without a safety line
Ac/Dc's gonna be fine

[Chorus: x3]
Be lucky
Be lucky
Be lucky, son

You wanna sell, you've got to kiss and tell
You gotta do a cover you of âHighway to Hell'
If you wanna fight, if you need to fight
Then you better get ready to run through the night

You want to travel across great divide
You really gotta have some luck on your side
You want to climb without a safety line
Daft Punk will tell you that it's gonna be fine

[Chorus: x3]
Be lucky
Be lucky
Be lucky, son

(Don't bet on paradises)
