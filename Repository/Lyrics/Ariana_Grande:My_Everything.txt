My Everything 
Ariana Grande

I've cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny
I really missed him
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
And saying sorry for the sake of us

He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taken me a lot to say
And now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time to push our pride away
'Cause you are, you are, you are my everything
You are, you are, you are my everything
