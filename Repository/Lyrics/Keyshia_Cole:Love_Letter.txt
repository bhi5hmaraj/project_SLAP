Love Letter 
Keyshia Cole

[Chorus:]
Every time you wrote me a love letter
Had me thinkin' that you could do better
But I'm calling all night and you ain't pickin' up this time

[Verse:]
Thinkin' about all the things you've done
See, I done went to the point of no return, babe
Cuz I can't take my actions back now
Oh, no, what are we gonna do now, the love is so lost, yeah
But I'm calling all night and you ain't pickin' up
Only crime knows where you at
My friend's tellin' me to just let it go
Let you calm, let you take a break
And maybe things will turn around
I see I done went to the point of no return
And you don't even know
Yeah, I done fucked up this time, baby
Oh, yes, I did

[Chorus:]
Every time you wrote me a love letter
Had me thinkin' that you could do better
Calling all night and I ain't pickin' up this time
Every time you wrote me a love letter
Had me thinkin' that you could do better
And you're callin' me all night, but I ain't takin' you back this time

[Verse 2: Future)
But even roses die, I can see the light
When you're further
Deep in the shadow of the valley of death
I got yo back like you got mine, baby
And fuck everything else
And I just wanna fuck with yo mind baby to fuck everything up
And just as long as you ain't cryin', baby to fuck everything up
Fuck everything up
I had a time when God has told me
We round(?) em up, but these rings don't mean a thing
I switched it up, got princes cut
Shit don't mean a thing
She on my nuts, she sayn you can't keep yo dick in yo jeans

[Chorus:]
Every time you wrote me a love letter
Had me thinkin' that you could do better
Calling all night and I ain't pickin' up this time
Oh no, every time you wrote me a love letter
Had me thinkin' that you could do better
And you're callin' me all night, but I ain't takin' you back this time
Oh, no

[Bridge:]
Every time I looked in yo eyes, baby
I thought that you really loved me deep
But see that's some shit you don't gotta teach
Yeah, baby
Lovin' you all night long, it feels so good
But I gotta let it go, see I gotta practice what I preach
Oh, this is my love song
