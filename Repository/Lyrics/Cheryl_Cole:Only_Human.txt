Only Human 
Cheryl Cole

[Verse:]
I've been holding out
For some silver in the clouds
It just gets dark
It just gets hard to see
Well you told me go for broke
You go first, I'll hold the rope
And make your way down to solid ground
With me

[Pre-Chorus:]
You are the universe
Do you see it, do you feel it hurt?
All the energy, stressing over what we're worth
It's only love
It's only dust
Making up the two of us
And we all, all fall down

[Chorus:]
You're only human
You're only human

[Verse 2:]
With your words stuck in your throat
Find our love through a telescope
Yeah, the view below gives me vertigo
So just keep your fingers crossed
Sign your luck and sing your loss
Until you love so loud
If you listen you can hear it shout

[Pre-Chorus:]
You are the universe
Do you see it, do you feel it hurt?
All the energy, stressing over what we're worth
It's only love
It's only dust
Making up the two of us
And we all, all fall down

[Chorus:]
You're only human
You're only human

[Bridge:]
I get out of the boxes I'm living in
I get out of this sin that I'm swimming in
Break it down, spit it out
Won't drown, won't track me down
I get out of the boxes I'm living in
I get out of this sin that I'm swimming in
Break it down, spit it out
Don't burn, let the colour burst

[Pre-Chorus:]
You are the universe
Do you see it, do you feel it hurt?
All the energy, stressing over what we're worth
It's only love
It's only dust
Making up the two of us
And we all, all fall down

[Chorus:]
You're only human (you're only human)
You're only human (you're only human)
You're only human
Ooh-ooh-ooh
You're only human
Oh, no, you're only human
