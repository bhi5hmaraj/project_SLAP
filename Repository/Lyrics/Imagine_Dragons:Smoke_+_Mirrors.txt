Smoke + Mirrors 
Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1]
This is my word, this is my way
Show me a sign, sweep me away
This is my word; heart breaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
Deep in my heart, deep in my mind
Take me away, take me away
This is my word; dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind

[Chorus]
All I believe, Is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?

[Verse 2]
All that I've known, buildings of stone
Fall to the ground without a sound
This is my word; heart breaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
I'm starting to cave, I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain
To disappear dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind

[Chorus]
All I believe, Is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
All I believe, Is it a dream?
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe
But all that I own
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
