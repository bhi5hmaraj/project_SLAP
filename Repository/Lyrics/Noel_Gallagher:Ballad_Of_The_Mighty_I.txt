Ballad Of The Mighty I 
Noel Gallagher

Followed you down to the end of the world
To wait outside your window
Heat or the rain I will call your name,
But you just passed me by
If you put me up like a fly on the wall
You'll be to blame where the heavens fall
Give me a sign, give me a sign (give me more)
But you just passed me by
The colours around me are faded away
And I'll be waiting, come what may
I'll find you
Yes, I'll find you (Yes, I'll find you)
âCause I gotta be the man that walks the earth alone
(Yes, I'll find you)

Followed the stars and I sail to the sun
Heaven in my fingers
Alone on a beach, on my own, out of reach
You just passed me by
Give you the world if you take my hand,
But you left me alone in the sinking sand
Strike up the band for one last stand
You just passed me by
Show me the rules of the games you play
And I'll be waiting, come what may
I'll find you
Yes, I'll find you (Yes, I'll find you)
If I gotta be the man that walks the earth
I'll find you (Yes, I'll find you)
Yes, I'll find you (Yes, I'll find you)
âCause I gotta be the man that walks the earth alone

Followed you now the end of the world
I wait outside your window
Heat or the rain I will call your name,
But you just passed me by
Every run, I'll be on your tail
Whatever you're hiding behind your vail
I'll find you, (Yes, I'll find you)
Yes, Iâll find you, (Yes, Iâll find you)
If I gotta be the man that walks the earth
I'll find you (Yes, I'll find you)
Yes, I'll find you (Yes, I'll find you)
If I gotta be the man that walks the earth aloneâ¦
