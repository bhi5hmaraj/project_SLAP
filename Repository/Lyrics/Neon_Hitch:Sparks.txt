Sparks 
Neon Hitch

Light flickers on
In my eyes we can't lie
In the dark I see you flyin'
In the shadows we are golden

Oh, I I'll love you till death do us apart,
Uh, oh I, I with the last breath of my heart

'Cause we are like sparks
We are we are we are alive
Can't wait no longer?
We are like sparks
We are we are we are alive,
So love me harder

Oh uh uh uh uuh
Oh uh uh uh uuh

Stars hold the plan,
I never know it had the night
Take my hand and show me how
Can you feel my skin, it's burning
Oh, I I'll love you till death do us apart,
Uh, oh I, I with the very last beat of my heart

[Chorus]
'Cause we are like sparks
We are we are we are alive
Can't wait no longer
We are like sparks
We are we are we are alive,
So love me harder

Oh uh uh uh uuh
Oh uh uh uh uuh
We are like sparks
Oh uh uh uh uuh
Oh uh uh uh uuh
We are like sparks

Ey ey eh eh eh
Ey ey eh eh eh
Ey ey eh eh eh
Ey ey eh eh eh

[Chorus]
'Cause we are like sparks
We are we are we are alive
Can't wait no longer
'Cause we are like sparks
We are we are we are alive
Can't wait no longer
We are like sparks
We are we are we are alive,
So love me harder

Ey ey eh eh eh
Ey ey eh eh eh
Ey ey eh eh eh
Ey ey eh eh eh
