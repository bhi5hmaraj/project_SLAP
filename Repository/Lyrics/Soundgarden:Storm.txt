Storm 
Soundgarden

The storm has weakened minds of steel
They dream to capture hopeless ones
This fear has passed and many can be
Those words unspoken we know it straight
We know it straight
It's straight

Watch as they're on faceless
Faceless
We waited there, faceless, faceless
My heart comes seeking faces
My, all around me is faceless

The storm has weakened minds of steel
They dream to capture hopeless ones
This fear has passed and many can be
Those words unspoken we know it straight
We know it straight
It's straight

Watch as they're on faceless
Faceless
We waited there, faceless, faceless
My heart comes seeking faces
My, all around me is faceless

[Outro: x4]
All hope follows corrupt
All hope follows corrupt
All straight follows corrupt
All straight follows corrupt
