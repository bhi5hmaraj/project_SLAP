Kind Ofâ¦ Sometimesâ¦ Maybe 
Jessie Ware

Do I get lonely at all?
No, cause Jamie and Johnny and Jack keep me warm
This wasn't my fault
I don't cry, god no I don't cry
Could you just leave it alone
You keep haunting my nights, you keep asking me twice
If I miss you at all
And now like, though I try

Oh kind of... Sometimes... Maybe
Kind of... Sometimes... Maybe
Oh kinda of... Sometimes... Maybe
Kind of... Sometimes... Kind of... Sometimes... Maybe

I'm less afraid of the dark
No bright ideas, I keep the lights on
Are you wasting my time?
And your time, every time
Why you making it hard?
I won't show you my cards, but you came and you lost
Do I want you at all?
Ok, just a bit, I hate to admit

Oh kind of... Sometimes... Maybe
Kind of... Sometimes... Maybe
Oh kinda of... Sometimes... Maybe
Kind of... Sometimes... Kind of... Sometimes... Maybe

I just sit here and I'm thinking
If I still want you
So why say kind of Sometimes... Maybe
Kind Of... Sometimes... Maybe
Kind Of... Sometimes... Maybe
Kind Of... Sometimes... Kind Of... Sometimes... Maybe
